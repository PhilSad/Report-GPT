{"rating": "2 star rating", "comment": "So, this is going to seem strange and unbelievable, especially with all the hate Amy's Baking Company has received. The food, in particular the sweet and spicy andouille pizza was actually pretty good.\nMy concern was the state Sammy (one of the owners) left the restroom. The guy you can see images of online came out of a stall directly before I did. He gave me this awkward half smile. The odor he left behind was, BY FAR, the worst I have ever encountered. It smelt like a dying animal. He also left a little toilet paper in the bowl, unflushed. I could hear his half assed handwashing too. The sink ran for less than 10 seconds. It literally made me sick to my stomach. I will not be returning.\nI really understand why my review would be seen as a troll. Honestly, I don't care if you don't trust me because they already get the hate they deserve.", "date": "Mar 10, 2023"},
{"rating": "3 star rating", "comment": "May 2013 Stardate log My posse and I (5 middle aged retired women) were passing thru town and the storefront caught our eye. The menu on Yelp seemed enticing! We ordered the vegetarian pizza ( too heavily loaded with veggies that were not dried of moisture making dough soggy); French onion soup (a whisker on the salty side for us but we are old lol) house salad (waitstaff said no customizations allowed ie no tomatoes-odd) Insalta Caprese which comes with a disclaimer *may contain pine nuts ?may? how would Chef not know ?  Blue Ribbon Burger which was beautifully plated but ordered well done served mooing. We returned it and it was returned in shambles. We returned it and asked it be removed from our check and was told that was against policy by the waitstaff. We asked to speak to a manager and the waitstaff said \"Oh please don't do that; I'll pay for the burger.\"\nFine with me as long as I didn't pay for it. \nThe wine selection was thin. Yelp indicated they specialized in wine and daily homemade deserts. We were eager to check those out. Every menopausal woman needs wine AND desert. We all ordered a different desert so we could share and compare. It was Captain Obvious these are store bought (I'm guessing Costco). They were nice but not homemade and not even daily plates and thrown in desert case. As I said we were just passing thru so take this review as a tourist.", "date": "Feb 4, 2020"},

{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "I went here before it closed on while on vacation in wonderful Arizona. \nThe food was mediocre and almost inedible. Restaurant looked nice though to have causal dining. \nOwners were very rude to others while there. Not very hospitable.", "date": "Jun 26, 2018"},
{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "Been there and the food is terrible! My father told them that the ravioli was cold and rotten and the owner ( Sammy I think his name was?) told us that we don't know what we are talking about and told us to f**k off and also that his wife's food is delicious. This was a few years ago by the way", "date": "Jun 24, 2018"},
{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "i was there in June 2013 and it was different to say the least. My burger was soggy and all and i was put down from who i understand to be SAMMY. I have never been treated like i was that afternoon.The dessert was Cream Brulee' (sp) it was to die for very good to say the least! I just learned that this place was actually on Kitchen Nightmare as i was watching a marathon of the show. knowing i had been way prior to the show, i am kinda in awe that i picked out a place that one day will be featured in a show. I will say the place looked incredible on the inside spotless isn't even a word to describe it. Just my thoughts on it", "date": "Jun 18, 2018"},
{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "Hello, this is a real review.\nI went, to this place before, kitchen nightmares. And, so far I have too say that this was the worst place ever, the food was incredibly non delicious. The waiter was nice, but whenever I wanted to speak to the manager he yelled at me to get out. Therefore this place didn't need 5 stars. \nAmy, was yelling back there. I have never seen something horribly done.", "date": "Jun 18, 2018"},
{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "This place was horrible. Great food but bad service. Been here many times.  Felt bad for the people who worked here.  Lots of drama. But good food. So that's why 1 star", "date": "Jun 14, 2018"},
{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "Terrible food!!! My pizza was underdone and my wife ravioli was FROZEN!!! The owner was yelling at people to F off and he threatened them with a kitchen knife. That's not a good thing to do to people and I think that he should've gotten fined for that. I would not reccomend this restaurant.", "date": "Jun 11, 2018"},
