The way they belittle their staff is disgusting and my entree had a problem but forget it they wouldn't hear of it. They said it was perfect! It's no wonder the place couldn't stay alive in an already tough as nails industry to survive in. You've got to cater to and pamper your guests if you want them to come back. Maybe Samy will find another woman with cooking skills and a much better personality to build a restaurant for and they will make it. As long as he stays out of the mechanical portions of the company. Amy is nothing more than a spoiled little princess who believes she can cook but doesn't have a clue about gourmet food she acts as though she's a princess but she's totally wrong.

I would have been happy to wait another 5 minutes to get a well cooked pizza after waiting so long. The restaurant was quite clean and the d\u00e9cor suited it very nicely. But the vibes in that place nearly gave me a panic attack. The woman who I assume was Amy was screaming at everyone, I felt bad for everyone who had to work with her. I personally would never eat here again.

The waiters were quite polite but seemed very nervous and afraid whenever I asked a question  on their menu and if they could ask the chef when my order would be ready. I ordered the french onion soup as an appetizer and waited for over 40 minutes, finally when my appetizer did arrive the onions were raw and the soup was oily and squishy and it just tasted too strong. When I tried to have it returned, one of the owners, Sammy, came out and asked me what was wrong, when I tried to explain he started yelling at me and telling me I was stupid, we were screaming in front of the other customers and his wife comes out and screams at me to get out because I don't know what quality food is!! I ate one spoonful of the soup and when I stood to leave, Amy demanded I pay for the appetizer, at this point many of the customers started to stand up and leave, one of the customers asked me at the door if I would like them to call the police, Sammy and Amy were screaming at me AND the other customer now, but after the threat with the police they just pushed us out the door. Completely HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.

Growing up in NY I am a bit of a pizza snob and let me tell you, this barely passed as edible. It was cold, the cheese wasn't fully cooked and looked like it might have actually been a microwavable pizza. When I asked if they could heat it in the oven for longer they copped the biggest attitude and made us wait for 30 minutes. Absolutely terrible!

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "I went to this place last June on my visit to Arizona. I am sad to see it go, I was aware of the episode on Kitchen Nightmares, but the Amy's Baking Company I went to was completely different. I was met with a warm welcome from Samy and being told to sit where ever I like. He immediately filled my glass with water, and strikes up a nice conversation. The menu was a lot simpler this time around, I came here with my wife, so we decided to try Amy's Lemon Garlic Hummus. It also came with Flat Bread for a couple dollars extra, however when it came, it was outright amazing. The hummus was the perfect consistency, while having the perfect amount of lemon flavor. The flat bread was crispy, fluffy and flavorful. Me and my wife had absolutely adored it. For our main course, my wife orders a Spicy and Sweet Asian Chicken Salad. I ordered a panini with muenster and prosciutto which was outstanding. My wife still talks about the dressing from her salad to this day, it was that good. Time for dessert, the display for desserts looks beautiful. Amy really knows how to make every dessert from scratch and make it taste like a culinary master piece. Me and my wife split the Lemon Tart, the filling was absolutely divine. It was topped with fresh meringue cooked with a flame torch. I was at shock at to how good everything was. I stupidly thought I was gonna come in and be served a subpar meal and be screamed at, but I received the complete opposite. I met Amy who was so delightful, I am sad to see that the restaurant was closed, it is unfortunate that terrible people like Gordon Ramsay had to ruin this place. I wish Amy and Samy the best of luck, and I hope one day I can try Amy's food once more.", "date": "Feb 19, 2016"},

Sammy was behind the counter and said something about how they were about to close but they would help us anyway.  I asked about the different cakes and desserts behind the counter and he wasn't sure so he called Amy over to help us.  I was pretty excited.  Amy was very nice and explained each of the different items.  We chose two different pieces of cake and took them to go.

We walked in and Sammi was at the counter. He was so kind, and very personable. We had a bit of a chit chat, and when I picked out a dessert (tiramisu) he replaced it with another one because it had fallen over on one side. It wasn't a necessary replacement, but it was such a kind gesture. He also made a point to use my husband's name, which again, is just such a great small gesture. I saw Amy briefly, and she honestly is just... so gorgeous.

The place has a LOT of seating but was completely empty. We didn't have time to stop and eat- but were more interested in the bakery items up front. The case wasn't too large but held a good amount of delicious looking desserts. Samy was very nice in explaining the desserts/flavors to us. We ended up with the bread pudding and a slice of cream filled layered chocolate cake. $10 a dessert. Somewhat pricey- but they appeared to be well made, so it's worth a try, right?\nThe chocolate cream filled layered cake was delicious. My husband and I agreed that it was the best cake we've ever had. Super flavorful and thick without being TOO rich. I wish I would've gotten more!\nThe bread pudding was good, but the cake was better ;) I think the walnuts in the bread pudding threw it off for me. But others might prefer it. Either way- both desserts were very quality  and definitely worth the stop. If their dessert is that good, I wonder how their FOOD is. Next time I'm in the area- I'll definitely be giving it a try.\nI guess my only suggestion would be to change the red sign on the outside of the place. It's so tacky and generic and doesn't really fit the feel of what they're trying to go for on the inside. A black sign with white font might be more attractive...\nEither way- great job on the desserts- delicious!\n***EDIT*** I REALLY hope Samy and Amy open up another location. It makes me super sad to see they're closed. I'm moving to the Phoenix area within the next couple months and was really hoping to make this one of my regular stops :( Boo.", "date": "May 4, 2015"},

If this is what they call \"fine dining\" then I will take a simply cheeseburger and fries any day. Their tomato basil soup was watery and gross, the challah roll was stale and hard, and  the albacore tuna from the albacore tuna salad tasted like it was canned. And don't even get me started about their pizza, I decided to be adventurous and try their BBQ Chicken Mango pizza. Remind me to never be adventurous again! The pizza was worst that I have ever tasted (and that is saying something!), the crust was undercooked, the chicken tasted rancid, and the pizza was cold! \nDon't even get me started on the service. I have never experienced such a rude, absurd, and disgusting service in my life! While my waitress was very nice and kept apologizing for my very long wait time, Samy was completely nasty. Has he ever heard of manners?! He was so dismissive of my family and I, and every time we went to complain about our meals he told us that we didn't know what we were talking about!

The food was good!!\nThe restaurant was beautiful and the food we ordered was great. My family and I go out to eat all the time when we travel.  My daughter wasn't sure if she wanted to order because of the reviews and stuff but reluctantly she did.  She loved her basil spaghetti.  My salami and arugula was great too.

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "In honesty, I probably would have given Amy's four stars (I don't just hand out five willy-nilly), but I feel like I should offset the bad reviews given by people who've never actually eaten here.\nThat said, I also must admit that I came with my friend because we loved the Kitchen Nightmare episode, but during our two hours there were nothing like what I saw on TV. Although I only saw Amy in passing, Sammy was super kind and gracious. I actually felt bad because he looked so stressed out when we walked in, yet the moment he noticed us he put on his game face and acted exactly like a wonderful host would. He went above and beyond to make sure that my buddy and I were having a great experience. \nEmpathy aside, the most important aspect of any restaurant experience is obviously the food-and man oh man was it good! We split the hummus, which is served with flat bread and all I can say is DE-LISH. The bread came out warm and soft and well seasoned. And as odd as this sounds, I was impressed that the bread didn't get stale in 20 minutes like most flat breads do. And the hummus was definitely fresh.Amy even sprinkles whole garbanzo beans on the top. I'm disappointed that I didn't get to try the cheese and prosciutto panini (because seriously you guys, prosciutto is the bomb), but my buddy was getting full and we had to order dessert, obvi. Again, no disappointments there! The desserts were beautiful, but more importantly they tasted excellent. My only complaint is that the desserts are pretty pricey (I have to add that Sammy was sure to let me know how much they cost, so I in no way felt cheated). I'm sure the price reflects the precision and labor that goes into making them so aesthetic (my friend's had glitter on it), but I guess the way I see it, fancy looking desserts are like nice lingerie-there's really no point because you're not going to look at it for more than five seconds anyway.\nIn conclusion, it's time to lift the ban on Amy's.", "date": "Apr 2, 2015"},

We then decided to split the Brie, apple, and prosciutto with an apple compote,it comes with a side salad with a citrus honey dressing that was absolutely to die for. The sandwich was nothing short of perfect. We made our way over to the baked goods counter and got two desserts. The chocolate cake and the creme brule cheesecake. I couldn't stop eating the decedent cake. It was gone within 5 bites. The cheesecake was also amazing but we decided to save it for the family to try.

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "I was in the Scottsdale area on business this week and after seeing the Kitchen Nightmares tv show about this place decided to check it out for myself to form my own (and fair) opinion.  This was a couple of days ago, but as I recollect back from my visit I decided I owed Samy and Amy an honest review.  \nI went in with a friend who lived in the Phoenix area who had never even heard of the place.  We arrived near closing time.  It was just Samy, Amy and someone they were chatting with inside.  Samy greeted us at the door in a friendly manner and asked if we were interested in dinner or dessert.  We said both and he apologized that he had just shut the kitchen down for the night, but we were welcome to get a dessert, to which we were fine with.\nSamy showed us the HUGE selection of desserts which actually took us a few minutes to make a decision on.  Samy explained in detail what each dessert was and every single one of them looked amazing.  We chose the chocolate with peanut butter cake as well as the cheesecake.  My friend got a coffee and I got a soda.\nWhile we were waiting for the food to be delivered to the table (which only took about a minute) we noticed how flawlessly clean the entire place was.  I remember on the show Gordon Ramsey was remarking about how the kitchen itself was amazingly clean, and that obviously extended into the dining area as well as the restroom which I used.  It really is one of those places where you could \"eat off of the floor\".\nThe desserts arrive and we sampled each other's.  Both desserts were absolutely delicious!  Quite possibly the best desserts I've ever had.  Just phenomenal.  In addition my friend said his coffee was excellent and likewise the Coke I got came from a machine that was clearly perfectly calibrated and had good water filtering on it.\nFurthermore as they had let the wait staff go home by the time we got there, Samy's attention to us as a waiter was spot on perfect.  He seemed to know exactly how to leave us alone to enjoy our food, but not for too long before checking up on us.  There is nothing worse than a waiter who ignores his customers or a waiter who simply keeps coming by asking if everything is ok.  Samy was spot on.\nAt this point I'll say that yes the tv show made the food look bad and it also made the service appear to be bad, but we did not experience even a hint of ANY of that.  Reality tv shows are often heavily edited to make things appear worse than they really are in order to initiate drama because drama sells.  I have to wonder just how much editing and provoking off-camera was actually happening.  For all we know the entire customer base on the day they shot that episode was all hired employees of Kitchen Nightmares told to go in acting as customers to provoke Samy and Amy.  \nRegardless that is only speculation because I've no involvement with the tv show, nor have I ever met Samy or Amy before in my life until last night, but what I CAN say is GIVE THESE GUYS A CHANCE!  Either the restaurant used to have major problems and they have since fixed them, or Ramsey's show misrepresented and twisted things around for the drama and to gain tv ratings.  My guess is it was possibly a little bit of both, but that doesn't change my 5 star review in the slightest bit.  My entire experience on Thursday night was flawless and I couldn't recommend Amy's Baking Company any higher.\nThis will ABSOLUTELY be a stopping point for me any time I am back in the Phoenix area.  Likewise my friend was so impressed he said he is going to start bringing people here as well.\nSamy and Amy, thank you for a lovely dessert and excellent service.  I look forward to having dinner with you soon.\nAnd Mr. Ramsey, I must say the ridiculously overpriced steak I had at your restaurant in Caesar's Palace last spring was dry and bland.  I didn't complain because I was with business clients, but THAT experience was a rip-off.", "date": "Jan 25, 2015"},

First of all, we met both owners and they were super nice.  We got our food in a timely manner and it was delicious.  We got a cheese panini and a turkey sandwich.  Yummmm.  Then a chocolate cake which was heavenly.  We will have to check out the show but as an unbiased reviewer we loved it!", "date": "Jan 23, 2015"},

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "I'll start off by saying that I came to Amy's Baking Company with a bit of trepidation. I felt like, as a tourist, the couple wouldn't appreciate an outsider showing up just to see that restaurant that was on Kitchen Nightmares\nI was HONESTLY scared to go into the place, fearing that Amy and Sammy would hate people like me. Man, was I ever wrong.\nAs I entered the restaurant Sammy kindly greeted my friend and I and told us to pick any table to sit at. He promptly brought us water and was SUPER friendly to us in every way. He gave us two menus and invited us to check out the desert display.\nAs we looked at the desert display Sammy walked us through what each plate was. He was calm, and articulate and very knowledgeable and PROUD of what his wife could bake.\nWe ordered a peanut thai salad with chicken (not exact name, sorry) and a panini (again, sorry, don't know the exact type)\nThe plates arrived promptly and both were beautifully plated. Sammy ran us through what was in each dish again as he presented it. Sammy also bragged about the quality of the food (which was great! Talk up your food if you are proud of it!)\nThe peanut thai salad was . . . pretty damn incredible. I'm a big ol fat guy, and the salad filled me right up. The sauce had a bit of a bite to it, which I loved, and was tossed with just enough sauce to make me happy, but not wanting more. The flavor was spot on, and the entire plate felt fresh and easy to eat.\nThe Panini (which I snuck a bite of) was also fantastic. Crispy on the outside (as it is grill pressed) and gooey and warm on the inside. The cheese was beautiful (I wish I knew what type it was) and the side salad of arugula was coated in a very light dressing which was super tasty and did well to hide the bitterness of the arugula. \nBoth dishes were ten dollars each, which in my opinion is a steal.\nThen came the deserts. A Peanut Butter chocolate cake, and a coconut chocolate cake. Holy shit you guys. I was really stupid to try to finish my entire LARGE salad, because I was almost too full to enjoy the amazing deserts. \nIt is pointless to try to explain how great they were. Just know that I'm a big fan of sweets, and my bar has been now set dangerously high on chocolate based cakes. Thanks for ruining me for life Amy. I'll have to visit Phoenix whenever I want to feel happiness again.\nSammy at one point caught me taking pictures of my food, and came over to encourage me to post about the food online. He, again, was nothing but kind to me and my friend.\nIt was weird. I felt a bit bad that I had come to the restaurant expecting to see caricatures and instead was met by two very kind and polite restaurant owners. I'm sure that others have had other experiences with the couple, but I cannot speak to those experiences. Both Sammy and Amy were proud of what they could do, and they SHOULD be. Their food was incredible.\nBoth took the time to take pictures with my friend and I and talked to us for a few minutes about the drama behind the Ramsey episode.\nI would love to visit ABC next time I am in Phoenix. \nCome for the possible drama, stay for the incredibly priced TASTY food. If you do not pick up a desert, you're an idiot.\nAlso, if you are going to go to ABC, don't be a prick and harass them just because we have turned their lives into a circus. The horror stories that those two told us were pretty grim. At the end of the day, they are still human beings. Give them a chance to surprise you.", "date": "Jan 6, 2015"},

To top off the night, we tried their still amazing desserts (a vanilla bean pie with lemon topping and the flourless peanut butter chocolate cake with ganoch chocolate).  All of it for a very affordable price!  Everyone needs to stop watching and commenting about the show and actually experience the hard work Sammy and Amy have put into redoing the restaurant.

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "To say that Amy's Baking Company was harshly judged by the internet (and the world) is a major understatement.  The food was not only good, it was spectacular.  The entire experience was exactly that, an experience.  \nSure, you could go out to eat.  Sit at a table and ingest food.  But at ABC, we were whisked away and treated as royal guests... almost family. \nFrom the minute we stepped in, Samy warmly greeted us and showed us to a table set for our arrival.  There was definite warmth in the decor and ambiance.  You can tell that the owners have put their entire heart and soul into the place and it is a sad fact that a silly television show and some internet bullies could drive a wedge between that and what is a truly wonderful experience for potential customers.\nI ordered the Curry Chicken Salad, which was nothing short of spectacular.  My father in law ordered the Sweet and Spicy Asian Peanut Salad, which I got to taste.  To say it was delicious is not doing it justice.  Addictive.  That's a better word.  The kids all finished their Panini's without prodding, which is a testament to the flavor in itself.  Words simply cannot describe the incredible tastes that filled our mouths.    \nAnd then there was dessert.  One thing that has never been in question was the quality of the dessert.  And it certainly lived up to the hype.  I had the Cr\u00e8me Brulee; the kids had the Flourless Chocolate Torte and Key Lime Pie.  It was at this point that we simply had to applaud the chef.  Amy graciously came out and thanked us all; she seemed genuinely touched that we enjoyed the food so much.  Her parting words to the kids were \"stand up to bullies, stand up for yourself.\"  Which I think was a wonderful message for them.       \nIf we lived in the area, we would go regularly.

He brought me in, packed up my dessert, and we chatted about politics. Sammy was very charming & respectful. It was a pleasant conversation over a touchy subject. Now to the food. I'm VERY high maintenance when it comes to desserts. If I'm going to indulge in that caloric intake, it better be worth it! I got the chocolate & peanut butter pie. All I have to say is WOW! As high maintenance I am with desserts in general, I am even more snobby when it comes to my favorite flavor combo of chocolate & peanut butter. This cake was hands down the best dessert I have ever had! It was a rich, creamy chocolate ganache with a ribbon of peanut butter inside. The balance was perfect! \nDon't buy into the negative hype.

{"rating": "2 star rating", "comment": "Was visiting old friends in Scottsdale and on my way to return back east. Stopped in last evening (10/18) this place for a quick bite. What brought me in was it looked nice from the outside. The place wasn't busy and now I know why.  An older gentleman seated me and all seemed nice. A lady (I'm guessing she's Amy because I did hear \"I'm the boss here..\") was bickering to some other staff member. I couldn't hear all of it, but it did make me nervous because she was obviously ticked off about something. This lady then walked around with what was obviously a forced smile and looking for things to tell others to do. This made the atmosphere a bit \"tense\".  I kind of got the feeling like she would come over to me and tell me to move or something because I wasn't sitting in the right place.  The menu was OK and the prices were a bit steep. (More like the prices you'd see in a closed venue, where you have to buy what's there, so prices are high.) I wound up getting a salad, figuring how could anything be wrong with that. It was \"OK\" - a bit bland and not worth the $$, but it wasn't bad. My server told me the desserts were great and I asked for the opinion on which was the best. I was told the cheesecake. Got that and while it was good, it was so-so.  So why 2 stars? Simply because of prices, portion size and the food being just so-so. My server did ask, sort of in a whisper, \"Did you hear about us from TV?\" I said no and was informed  \"this place was on Kitchen Nightmares\". I don't watch reality TV or that show, so I didn't know.  I certainly wouldn't call this place a nightmare, but it does need some help. They should put more effort into the food, prices and creating a less \"tense\" atmosphere, instead of decor. When I left, the phrase that came to mind was not judging a book by its cover.  Now that I am back home (and recovering from jet lag from last nights flight), I am going to go to a local small restaurant that isn't \"beautiful\", but the food and service are worth 5 stars! If Amy's Baking Company was on that show, I hope they learned something and are in the process of changing. I'll be back in AZ visiting next year and will ask my friends there if they recommend this place then.", "date": "Oct 19, 2014"},

We passed on having dessert at the restaurant we had dinner at and came here. WE ARE SO GLAD WE DID!! \nThe pastries were amazing! The caramel chocolate truffle was just to die for. The creme brulee was perfect, with a slight hint of lemon which was refreshing. And since it looked so good we also shared the flourless chocolate torte that was dense, rich and chocolatey. We couldn't stop eating it all.\nWe were the only people in the restaurant, close to their closing time which made it quiet and cozy. The staff was friendly and the owner was extremely nice to us. \nWe DEFINITELY will go back for dessert. It was way better than many top places in town. \nThank you for a nice end to our night.", "date": "Oct 19, 2014"},

{"rating": "3 star rating", "comment": "This was neither the best or worst dining experience I have had. I am a restauranteur with three restaurants (Italian, Greek, and a Steakhouse Pub) in the second largest city in our state. I am a CIA trained chef and have a BA in Hospitality Management...suffice it to say, I know food and I know the restaurant business having worked in the industry 18 years.\nThe wait staff were pleasant and engaging. Samy stopped by to touch base with us once before the entr\u00e9es were served (it was my wife and I) and once during the meal. The salads and entr\u00e9es, while neither excellent nor horrible, were merely adequate. We did not find ourselves engaged in any drama, but did witness an episode of what I would call poor customer service between Samy and a party of three diners two tables away. I have dealt with customers who definitely were NOT 'always right' in my time, but have always managed a gracious conclusion by comping drinks or sometimes eating the whole check just to bring the exchange to a close. That is a built-in cost of any successful restaurant. Unfortunately, should they try again for a reservation, we are usually too booked to accommodate them....any day...any time.\nI must admit the desserts were tasty. If I could fly them in freshly, I would put a few of them in my own Italian and Steakhouse restaurants.\nSo, in summary...the food rates a 3 (salads and entrees: 2 & desserts: a solid 4) the wait staff a solid 4, the ambiance (AKA \"floor show\") a 1, the service flow and wait times a 2. This averages to a 2.5, and although we did have spotty silverware (hey, it happens), the dining room was airy, aromatic, and clean. This was definitely worth .5 stars. As such, 3 stars it is...we would return to try it for ourselves but would not make it our first recommendation for European dining in Scottsdale.", "date": "Sep 13, 2014"},

Greeted nicely bye our server and Sammy!. We had the pear salad witch had amazing caramelized pecans those are worth the salad alone( Please keep on the menu!). We had 3 mains between the 3 of us. The gnocchi was really good nice flavor and taste to the sauce. The Fettuccini Alfredo sauce was really good. and father had Spaghetti and Meatballs witch looked good. Honestly I didn't want to mention anything about the show and come on a open mind, witch I think everyone should when eating out and not eating at chains rather then small business witch we should support. We met Amy and Sammy and its nice to see owners actually coming out and greeting guest. I know its hard to especially having owned one ourselves. We went on a Friday small crowd in and out under 1 hr tops. I wish I could say that we had the same experience at Gordon's. However I highly recommend checking out this place and giving it a chance. Try on slow time during weekend trade, depending on how fast you need to be in and out weather catching a show at the movies or shopping locally. We all need to support small business owners.

We checked out the dessert display on the way in and everything looked amazing so we ordered the candy bar tart to go.  It too was fantastic!  Only things preventing me from giving 5 stars are as follows:  never took a drink order or offered anything other than water, even though the restaurant was slow, it did take awhile to get our food and then to get the check.  I wouldn't recommend going if you are on a time crunch.  Can't speak as to how criticism is handled as our experience was pleasant and it appeared the other diners were happy as well.

I walked into the restaurant at 7pm on a Friday night, and the place was half empty. I ordered the salmon burger with a salad, and although the food wasn't as bad as I was expecting, it definitely wasn't what I would call restaurant quality. I expected the bun to be soggy, but it was actually a bit stale. The salmon was dry and tasteless. The salad was ok, but the oil and vinegar dressing had way too much vinegar. Although the waitress was pleasant, the service was mediocre at best. Because I wanted the waitress and not the owners to get the tip, left a lousy 5% tip on my credit card and asked the waitress to meet me outside after I left so I could give her the remainder of her tip in cash. She agreed, and was extremely thankful.

The food was a little overpriced but everything we had was good.  Veggie pizza,  spinach pesto gnocchi, and oir daughter had a simple penne with tomato sauce. We took two desserts to go. Everyone was incredibly friendly.

When we arrived, we were greeted with a nice hello from a lovely waitress who then showed us to our seat.  After looking over the menu, we decided to get some salads and pizza.  The salads came to our table in a timely manner but were very soggy.  I asked the older gentleman who I assume was the manager if we could get salads that were not so soggy...he seemed rather upset by my question but did take our salads back and returned a little later with salads that were not as soggy (but these tasted strange so we decided not to finish them).   After a very long wait, our pizza finally arrived and it was overcooked and did not have much cheese and toppings on it.  Needless to say, we were very disappointed in this establishment and will never dine here again.", "date": "Jul 20, 2014"},

I must say, I was impressed, and will be back the next time I am in Scottsdale.\nMy husband had the Three Cheese Pizza.  The crust was fabulous.  Nice crunch on the bottom, with a fluffy, savory center.  The flavors of the cheese, along with the beaten egg were perfect.\nI had the Homemade Lasagna with Bolognese and Pepperoni.  The lasagna came out hot and was obviously freshly prepared.  The Bolognese Meat Sauce was robust and flavorful.  The cheese to noodle to sauce ratio were perfect.\nThe portions of food were huge, and aptly fit the price.  My husband and I both only ate half of our meals, so we would be able to save room for one of Amy's delectable desserts.  We chose a Creme Brulee and Chocolate Cake.  This dessert was the perfect ending to our meal.  It was rich in flavor and the combination of chocolate and Creme Brulee will definitely make my mouth water at every thought.  \nOur service was that of a 5 star restaurant.  Both, Samy and the waitress (I didn't catch her name) were attentive and a pleasure to speak with.  \nWe had a wonderful experience, and will defintely be back.", "date": "Jul 19, 2014"},
{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "Of course you may have heard of Amys' Baking Company from TV. It did not cast it in a good light, and now that I have visited I can tell you my Experience was anything but dramatic.\nThe owner Samy Greeted us at the door and we asked to be seated as we were excited to try some food from this controversial kitchen. The menu was filled with appetizing pizza combinations, hummus and bread appetizers, but I wasn't thorough because I lasered in on the FIG PROSCIUTTO PIZZA instantly and knew i wanted to try it. He assured us it was a filling meal and that is all I wanted, plus cake.\nAs we waited we walked over to the amazing dessert display in the front and I saw tons of amazing delectable's. Flourless Chocolate Truffle, Creme Brule, Flourless German Chocolate , Truffle Chocolate with MEOW written on it, Key Lime Pie and Candy Bar Tart. There was even a new item Amy had made that day with raisins and that was so intriguing. She really does have a Flour Thumb, its like a green thumb except for baking. It was delicious and from there we ordered 3 kinds of cake to take home with us. \nEach was easily the best of its category that I have ever tried. The German Chocolate, the Flourless Chocolate sans Peanut, and the Chocolate Truffle were totally worth it. The Flourless German had a perfect brown cream frosting on top with coconut shaving and the coolest gold edible glitter I have ever seen. Which was surprising as I have never seen that before. Turns out Amy makes this herself and that is awesome.\nThe Fig Prosciutto Pizza was soo good. The saltiness of the meat, the fresh home grown figs, the cheeses, and the kalamata olives mixed in this totally unexpected way that just made you want more. I ate all that pizza. There is no sharing when you get one.\nThe restaurant was beautifully decorated with cool black chandeliers and extremely clean. I think its really unfair that these owners have had to deal with so much negativity, because when you eat the food and enjoy your time here its just sad to know that passionate people can become targeted for instances of behavior that don't reflect the quality of the business. \nNext time I visit Phoenix I won't leave until I have eaten at Amy's. :D", "date": "Jul 17, 2014"},

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "Seriously Yelp? What is the deal here. The situation surrounding this restaurant has me doubting the validity of Yelp and all restaurant rating sites alike. I saw the reviews and watched the Gordon Ramsey show (and the follow up) so I was curious to see what Amy's is really like. I don't live in the area, but have been on vacation in Phoenix, so I made the trip out to Scottsdale mostly for the novelty and was expecting the worst. \nThe place was completely empty, though we did arrive at 1:30 on a Saturday. Nice indoor seating as well as a patio, immaculately clean everywhere. There are probably 12 small tables inside and a giant display of bakery goods. We were seated at the window by the only waitress working. She was friendly. Sammy and Amy were both there. Sammy checked on us several times and was pleasant. Asked us about our visit, etc. \nWe ordered the jalape\u00f1o artichoke dip as an appetizer. It was huge, probably enough for four people but we ate the whole thing. The dip was refreshing and spicy. Really want the recipe because it would make great tailgating food. The bread was some of the best I have ever tasted. Very soft and flavorful; smelled good too.\nThe pizza we ordered had prosciutto, pear, figs, caramelized onions, and goat cheese on it. My boyfriend and I both agreed it was  probably the best pizza we have ever had. We are not mere pizza charlatans; we have eaten pizza from famous pizzerias far and wide, including the allegedly fabulous Pizzeria Bianco just a few miles away (Which sucks, by the way). The prosciutto was melt in your mouth delicious and there were just a TON of toppings on it. Whole figs! Delicious goat cheese! The crust is made of the same bread as the appetizer comes with. It's softer than most pizzas but was perfect for the toppings we chose. We only ate three pieces between the two of us because it is a huge serving.\nWe paid (~$25 for app and pizza with waters) and then looked at the bakery display. We were too full to get anything but they looked beautiful. Amy came out and chatted with us for a bit and was very sweet and thanked us for complimenting her food and for eating there.\nWould come back in a heartbeat if I lived here. Loved the food and that is what is most important. What everyone needs to keep in mind is that television crews can make anyone look crazy if they want to. To be fair, many reviewers have actually bullied these people who are simply working hard to make a living. Dine here with an open mind and then pass your own judgment. I sure am glad I gave it a chance.", "date": "Jul 12, 2014"},
{"rating": "3 star rating", "comment": "Well, finally went to Amy's Baking Company with my wife and friends tonight and I waffled between 2 and 3 stars. I have to keep reminding myself why I give great reviews and not so great reviews. Our waitress was pleasant. The food was alright and Sammy kept an eye on us to make sure that our party of 6 was attended to. We were the only ones there on this Friday night and had entrees and desert. I'm stuffed as I write this and had to have my entree and desert boxed up. \nMy thoughts, go try it yourself. We all have opinions and my recommendation is that try it first before you Yelp about it. Or talk to people about your experiences. The internet and media realm is a constant moving truck and one never forgets things in this day and age. There was no drama or yelling in the background. Amy and Sammy and the one waitress there thanked us for coming in and the wait time wasn't bad at all for our food. \nNothing negative to report here. Time can be a great tell, and time will tell many things. With that, the night is concluded.", "date": "Jul 11, 2014"},
{"rating": "4 star rating", "comment": "Tonight was my second visit to ABC. My family and I went there the first time because we were intrigued by the drama on Kitchen Nightmares. We are HUGE fans of Chef Gordon Ramsay and have seen every episode about 5 times.\nTrip 1 (summer of 2013): After watching the show we psyched ourselves out about how crazy the owners were. We were nervous going into the store and made our plan to go in and look at the desserts, pick something out, and eat it at home. Sammy was in the front and boxed up our desserts and rang us up. He was nice. We could see Amy in the back and anxiously hoped she would make an appearance. Alas, we did not get to meet her. We took our desserts to a friend's house and shared them all with each other. The desserts were great. \nTrip 2 (tonight): I went to a movie by myself. I kidded with my husband about going to see Amy. We had actually just seen the ABC episode yesterday and had a laugh about it again. After the movie I stopped in. I asked Sammy if he had anything with PB. He smiled and said yes. Amy was also out front. I made a comment that my family was a peanut butter family so that's what I wanted. She made a joke and then started to box it up while Sammy (I apologize if I am spelling his name wrong) rang me up. She asked if I was going right home, because if I wasn't she was going to give me some ice or something to keep it cold. As I was leaving she said she put some extra caramel in the box for me. I still got the jitters throughout the transaction because I kept waiting for something to happen (flashbacks to the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld), but they were both nice. I surprised my family with the dessert and we all dug in and agreed it was delicious. \nAs much as I would love to have a cool \"Amy is crazy\" story, I don't. Both trips the owners were kind, the desserts were good, and there was no drama. I don't go to the movies at that location but maybe once or twice a year, but I will probably go to ABC again for a dessert the next time I am over that way. \nAlso, I couldn't do 5 stars yet because I have never eaten a full meal, just the dessert.

Your wait staff \"constantly apologizing.\" This is even before you get seated. They were great! After 10 or so minutes. You can hear people(what sounds like several people) it was Amy, Sammy and one of their waitress's coming out the back from somewhere. Screaming match ensues. This was not between our server and Amy and Sammy. It was Amy screaming more like a shrieking really at Sammy. My girlfriend and I left money on the table to pay for her drink. My girlfriend made me wait in the parking lot for our server to come outside. My girlfriend gave her(our server) a tip. Long story short, this old white haired man comes outside in what to me was a child like tantrum. Continually yelling so loud.

We got there at 3:15pm, only to find that they were closed! Nowhere on their website did it say that they would be closed in the middle of the afternoon, but when I got there, there was a sign on the door that said they were closed from 3-5pm. Would have been really nice to know that BEFORE we got there. \nSo much for trying Amy's cakes. Instead, we went to Chompies and had a delicious cheesecake and creme brulee.

I am now just getting around writing my review after Kitchen Nightmare's new episode on this establishment reminded me of the frenzy over this restaurant. \nFirst off, please do not be fooled by the many many fake reviews on here, lots of people apparently find it funny to just write whatever Chef Ramsay had pointed out on national tv in the first episode. This poor behavior from fellow reviewers also prompted me to say my 2 cents which had actual credence considering I've been there! \nTheir food is actually really good. Their hummus and Gnocchi were phenomenal. It's silly to think that their food would be of actual horrible quality, the restaurant itself is immaculate and clean, but I wanted to decide for myself and I am so glad I have done so. \nSammy was our \"waiter\" he was constantly followed by two girls who seemed a little lost. He is, to be fair, exactly like he is portrayed on the show. He talks a mile a minute, assures you everything on the menu is SO good and so on... My boyfriend told him of our family restaurant in Los Angeles to which Sammy proudly responded that HE is planning to come to Los Angeles to open a new restaurant (.... Bit of an exaggeration I'm sure, but fuck, I'm down to go!) so they are somewhat milking their instant celebrity and I don't blame them but they are quite the characters. \nSadly Amy came out of the kitchen only once, she looks much skinnier in real life. \nAlso, be on the lookout for the cat statue above the desert fridge  - meow meow.", "date": "Jun 4, 2014"},

Everything came out in a timely manner, nothing seemed rushed and we were checked on unobtrusively on several occasions. \nWe ordered the pear salad and the meatball pizza. Both were really good and the pizza was not soggy!\nIt does seem that staff may be on edge a little as if they are getting people in there all the time to give them trouble, but if your food is good and you compliment them on it, Samy will walk away from your table with a proud, beaming smile and shake your hand as you leave. \nHonestly, the food was really good, the service was great and we felt appreciated.  Leaving a restaurant feeling appreciated goes a long way in this day and age. \nPerhaps they may have had some issues in the past, or perhaps the show needed some ratings and baited them for some drama?  After my visit, I am thinking they may have been baited for drama and ratings. I have a feeling you get back what you give when you enter this restaurant and that is normal in life, right?  \nI come to Scottsdale on a monthly basis for work and I can honestly say I will come back again.

Which was the chocolate cake and it was absolutely delicious. So As far as desserts I give AMY 5 stars.\nNOW, the rest of the experience was where it all went down hill drastically. I ordered a pizza, and the outer crust was beautiful and very rustic like. The actual innards of the pizza was raw and soggy. the flavor was strong with garlic on one side and completely bland on the other side. I sent it back asking if it could be put back in the oven for another 10 minutes and the SHRILL scream that came from the kitchen was enough to make me lose my appetite. My friends had gnocchi which tasted freezer burned and no matter how much sauce is put on, the freezer burn taste doesn't go away.\nIt's a beautiful restaurant and well worth the money put into it, but our server was so nervous and jumpy afraid that she would do anything wrong. When I asked if she gets the tips from the tables, she shook her head no, Since I was paying the bill, I paid it in cash to the penny, and then I sought out my server and gave her a 30% tip for putting up with the environment she works under.\nIn my opinion, all of these glowing 5 star rating must be from friends or relatives to offset the lower ratings. I'm from NJ so I didn't travel 3000 miles to \"Bully\" these people. I wanted to form my own opinion and it spoke for itself.\nHow they are open is a mystery.

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "First, let me start by admitting that I am a huge Gordon Ramsay fan, and didn't expect to have a good experience when I arrived at Amy's Baking Company.  I was wildly mistaken.\nMy girlfriend and I made a visit to ABC last night for dinner. Right when we walked in, Sammy cordially greeted us and invited us to look around before we were seated.  I was surprised at how personable and down to earth he was.  \nWe decided to sit outside on the patio, because of the design it was secluded and spacious at the same time, and had relaxing, unique music playing in the background.  We love to sit on the patio at restaurants, and although the weather didn't warrant it, we were also glad to see they have several fans and misters for when we get deeper into the summer.\nOur server was also pleasant, and we decided to start with a few drinks and some flatbread with spinach and artichoke dip.  I had read that someone was upset that the bread had to be purchased separately, but given the amount of bread they gave and how tasty it was, I felt like it was absolutely worth the cost.\nMy girlfriend ordered champagne, and I excitedly ordered the Vanilla Bean Vodka after finding out that the Vodka is homemade.  The glasses were unique and we enjoyed our drinks while taking in the ambiance and relaxing music in the background. \nThe flatbread was almost a meal in itself, and we took some home.  On that note, it was really nice how the waitress offered to box it up for us immediately, as she did after our dinner and dessert.\nWe had asked Samy what he recommends for a pizza, and he suggested the Fig Pear Prosciutto.  It did not disappoint.  I especially loved the caramelized  onions.  The sweet and savory combination was a perfect blend.\nFinally, I am not really into sweets, but given the reputation they have for having exquisite desserts at ABC, I had to.  My girlfriend was delighted that they had flourless chocolate cake, and I chose the German chocolate cake.  Both were delicious.\nWe're still in a shock of sorts because of how low our expectations were coupled with the absolutely excellent experience we had.  Samy and Amy were pleasant people, and their food and restaurant are exceptional.  We went from being hesitant of going because of what we had seen, heard, and read to having one of the best dining experiences we have ever had.\nI really do watch Kitchen Nightmares on a regular basis, am a big fan, and have gone to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants.  At the same time, I admire how Samy and Amy have sustained amidst the criticism and backlash and am happy that we gave it a chance.  We'll definitely be returning again soon!", "date": "May 3, 2014"},

{"rating": "4 star rating", "comment": "We live in Queen Creek about 45 minutes from ABC.  My brother, from New Orleans, was visiting his daughter and grandchildren in Tempe, so we decided to try ABC for lunch on April 19th.  I will admit that we tried ABC because of all the publicity.\nWe arrived a few minutes before they open (12 noon).  Sammy was cleaning and rinsing the patio.  He came over and opened the door allowing us to enter early.  The interior is beautiful.  \nSammy waited on us.  There were additional wait staff, but Sammy was our waiter.  We started with garlic flat bread.  A great way to start the meal and continue eating it through the meal.  I took some home for later!\nMy wife had the \"Pear Salad\".  The greens looked and according to my wife were very fresh.  The salad contained crispy, tasty pieces of pear.  She was unable to eat the whole salad.\nMy brother had the Spinach Ravioli.  He chowed down the entire plate.  When I told him they were not fresh raviolis, he said, \"so... the taste is what counts and I enjoyed them.\"  I cannot argue with that logic.\nI had the Sweet and Spicy Pasta Arustica (sp?).  The flavors were a little different, first a little sweetness, then a few moments later, a little spice kick. The dish matched the description.  I ate most of mine, finishing up as a snack that night.\nWe each agreed that our meals were very good and would order them again.\nRarely, do we get dessert when we go out to eat.  However, the presentation case was so inviting that we picked dessert to go.  My wife chose the White Chocolate Coconut Cream Tart while I picked the Chocolate/Caramel Tart.  These were wonderful.  They were so decadent that we could only eat a couple of bites at a time.  They lasted several days.\nSammy was a gracious host and waiter!\nThere was no drama while we were there, nor was their any reason for any drama.\nWhen we are in the Scottsdale area, we will return to ABC.\nFYI: The menu on the web site is out of date.  ABC no longer serves burgers.  They need to update their web page and remove them.", "date": "Apr 28, 2014"},

{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "I was going to give a 5 star rating because, for who they are, the owners are busting their buts to have their own type of restaurant. But after I saw the follow up on KN tonight, I can only give 1 star, even BEFORE I come to the restaurant. The reason for this is so little has changed since the original airing of the show and after what I saw on the update show recently.\nI will be visiting the restaurant on my next trip out West. In response to the owner's  comments on KN recently, I will introduce myself and show Amy my Ylep post. I'm not hiding behind my computer. After I come, I will not return again since the husband said \"stuppid people will become smart and come back\".\nThe purpose of me writing this review is that  I had  the hope the owners would change their attitude towards their employees. They don't understand that although employees do not own the restaurant, they can make or break a business. I beg of owners to learn to treat them better and think about how it felt when they had to work for someone else. Since they fired the entire original staff, I'm not too optomistic. Employees don't owe you anything, they are there to provide a service to you for a fee. When you start to take those fees away (the tips they earn), then you are in the wrong. How you treat our future leaders will come back to haunt you.\nLastly, I am expecting good food and good service, if I don't receive that I will make it known to you. I did notice the business is still not growing and the restaurant has few customers. All you have to do is read the posts on review sites the same way everyone else does and you will get your answers to WHY?", "date": "Apr 25, 2014"},

I do have to say that I am a coffee and french onion soup snob.\nWhat a pleasant surprise to have my delicious coffee arrive in a french press with a demitasse cup and spoon and small ceramic creamer.

But they did a nice job with it. \nThe prices were a little higher than I usually pay, but thats Scottsdale for you. I felt like the portions were at least fair for what we paid.\nWe had a mixed green salad with a really tasty dressing and a three cheese pizza. It had a little too much flour on the bottom for my taste but otherwise nothing wrong with it. I liked the tart goat cheese and the fact that it had a bit of pesto and a bit of red sauce. In fact, we devoured every crumb of the pizza, even our daughter who is maybe the pickiest human being that has ever lived.\nSammy was attentive and didn't insult and berate us one bit. But then again, we didn't antagonize him. Sometimes being nice to people goes a long way.\nSo what if they order in their desserts?

I was visiting AZ on a business trip and went into this place not having heard anything about it before. The place looked fantastic and the host/owner seemed friendly at first. The waitress was nice too, and warned us about possibly having to wait for our food even though the place was practically empty. \nMy pasta came in almost an hour later while my mate's food was nowhere to be found. I'll be honest my pasta tasted fine..nothing special but it was decent. My friend's meal comes in well after an hour and a half and it was apparently cold and peppery. When he tried to send it back, the owner came to enquire about the issue and took it back. At this point we didn't wanna wait another hour for his food and wanted to leave and then things got ugly. The owner demanded we pay for the food we returned or wait and when we refused he was rude and obnoxious. After a bit of back and forth we got our way but not before they said we weren't welcome back in their restaurant. \nAfter watching the episode I feel like we actually got treated quite well compared to their other customers and I wouldn't go back there even if their food was brilliant.", "date": "Apr 21, 2014"},

I ate there for their reopening.:\nThere were three of us that ate there tonight and we did our version of a a tasting menu aka sharing our food. I had the portabella sandwich, my new friends order the pesto gnocchi with the house salad with the lemon dill dressing and the 18\" Margarita pizza. First my sandwich was was bland. The red peppers weren't roasted enough and the bottom bun was very soggy. I'll let that pass since I cut it into four portions for sharing. Winner was the Pita Jungle portabella sandwich which is what I had earlier in the evening. \nThe gnocchi were swimming in the sauce. You could taste the pesto but it left a salty after taste the gnocchi texture was dead on however. The pizza was the worst thing. Toasty crust on one side and much lighter on the other. It was bland too and not to mention soggy in the middle.  We each had a slice and the rest went home with Apyrl.\nHere's the time table...seated at 8:32, signed the waivers as they were filming for their purposes, order taken at 8:42. Culinary Connie's salad arrived at 9:25 and the rest of the meal, one at a time at 9:40, 41 and we were asked if there was anything else and we told the food runner we were waiting on a pizza which was immediately brought out to us. Water was constantly refilled but it was warm (probably tap) from a plastic tupperware like container. The ice in my glass was melted and never re-added to my glass or the pitcher of water keep the water cool.\nI asked our server is she gets the tips and she said that everyone was asking that. I paid with my card and gave her cash. We asked for separate checks when we placed the order and was told it wouldn't be a problem. As on KN, Samy entered all the tickets and we received one bill at the end of the night. Samy seemed a bit flustered as our server tried to explain to him who had what. He came over and said to me what did you have? Mushroom. Okay around $17. Around? He did have it correct when the receipt came out. Apyrl was paying cash wanted a receipt so she could put it on her expense report as she was in town on business/seeing family. He ended up giving her the receipt for all three of us. She left $5 on the table and he made a point to tell the server that it was hers.\nThe service was very good. Very attentive and always smiling.", "date": "Apr 11, 2014"},

That's when we started having problems not only were we told we couldn't have what we wanted our message on the cake to say or have a cross because it was against their religion. So Amy agreed to do a small cross and the message \"blessed with our miracle from above\" which was a good comprise when we got it it said our miracle and her name nothing else! So I guess that's the way they try to make their customers happy and it wasn't the cake we'd originally ordered it wasn't at all. As if it couldn't get worse but the cake was literally frozen inside and we were charged twice the amount we were quoted by the owner. So the whole experience seemed shady and we never returned. Why agree to making a cake for a catholic baptism if you're not going to try to make your customer happy. The quality was horrible we were stuck serving a frozen cake to our guests.

He was actually the one who brought up tv and Gordon Ramsay, out of nowhere, as I was trying to play it cool...not sure if he was just being honest and up front or just proud of the publicity and attention (even if it has been largely negative).  We didn't talk to Amy, but I did see her through the kitchen door and her touch was evident throughout the dessert case with the little chocolate \"Meow!\" tags topping many of the desserts.\nIn regards to the desserts themselves, they were good, but not necessarily amazing.

Amy put sparklers on our birthday cake which made my 12 year old laugh silly. Homemade butternut squash soup which comes with a homemade piece of bread with little tiny onions, sage and some homemade creme la fraiche...amazing flavor and usually the soup of the day, couple with the house salad with honey citrus dressing also homemade with organic greens, onions and tomatoes - there house salad was amazing, fresh and huge and only $5.00  other places sell this size salad for double or triple...There pizza dough is light and airy and you can add or subtract any ingredients to make your very own pizza.  I like white pizza especially with the goat cheese, garlic, pesto, basil.  it is very good.  Oh by the way...Amy makes all her desserts, they are not store bought, they are home made by Amy and delicious...I have to try the Lemon Meringue next time was too full this time around.  The ice coffee looked amazing and was huge I mean huge.  If you have food allergies this place is the place to go, they will try their best to accommodate you.  everything is made from scratch, nothing comes from a can, they do not use a corn, potato flours and absolutely no soy products of any kind....There homemade pizza crust, flat bread and buns are melt in your mouth......The price for the pastries are right in line and taste amazing...Once again great service, great conversation, great friends, and great organic made to order food.

He is a very fun guy and seemed very accommodating. He really went into detail about the different ingredients of all of the pizzas after we were unsure of what one to order. We said we wanted something a little bit different than the usual fast food pizza and so we chose the fig pizza. We ordered the small since it was just two of us after he advised us that they are actually pretty big and he did not want us to over order( which shows us he actually cares and isnt just a greedy guy). The pizza arrived promptly and it was a beauty. You can really tell just by looking at is that everything is made from scratch. The crust was soft but firm and the pizza was thin and cooked crispy and perfect. The flavor contrast with the sour cheese and sweet onion and fig were to die for. Overall the experience could not have been better, A+ service and food. The only two things I care about when dining out.

We went on a Friday night and like usual, I deferred to my girlfriend for appetizers and drinks. We got the flatbread which was okay and my girlfriend wanted the olive appetizer. I absolutely hate olives so I'm not going to judge ABC at all on them because they could've been the best olives in the world and I wouldn't have touched them. Girlfriend said they were 'good' and ate them all, so that was fine. Paying just 5$ for the flatbread or just 5$ for the olives would've seemed like a ripoff, but it felt fine paying 10 for the pair. It was plenty of food and most appetizers are around that price range anyways, so no complaints. We split the...mango and something pizza. Mango was the 'odd' ingredient so that's the memorable part, I think there was chicken on it too? Either way, along with olives, I hate cilantro and onions, and this was loaded with them. My girlfriend loves all of the above, so I deferred to her since it was a date night. I had a couple slices. It was cooked fine, I just didn't like half the ingredients (not ABCs fault though). However, I was disappointed, more in what we chose than the actual food quality.\nI vowed to go back a couple days later, because it didn't feel fair judging a restaurant over a bunch of choices I wouldn't've gotten normally. I got a house salad with their house vinaigrette, it was very tasty! Lettuce was real crisp, tomatoes tasted like they were slightly spiced (could be wrong though). It just tasted fresh and the dressing didn't taste store-bought, though I'm not the best with that.\nI went with the chicken parmesan this time, and the red sauce was absolutely delicious. I had to ask the waitress over to find out what it was, and she said it was a basil red sauce. I could've had that for my beverage. It came with penne and I would've preferred spaghetti but that sauce was so good I just ate it up with the penne. Chicken was cooked fine, no complaints. it didn't detract from the amazing sauce though. Man, if I lived in Scottsdale I would just buy that by the pint as often as possible. When I came back to NC I went to my favorite Italian place and got chicken parm, the chicken was probably cooked a tad bit better but the sauce just wasn't comparable. I'm drooling about it right now.\nMy girlfriend got Gnocchi with Bolognese sauce. She loves Bolognese and she cleaned her plate.\nI don't remember what the cake we got was, my girlfriend wanted it. It was shaped in a heart and was chocolate. It was tasty but eight bucks. Too small for eight bucks. I preferred to not look at the bill as it was expensive, but that basil red sauce, oh man. 4 stars because it was too expensive.

I'm Absolutely Amazed! \nThe place was probably one of the cleanest restaurants that I have ever been in. I'm a stickler for cleanliness (18-yrs Army) and Sammy and Amy obvioulsy keep that place spotless; they would make any Drill Sergeant proud, jealous, and envious all in one - if thats even possible. \nThe service was excellent, the prices were more than fair. Sammy was extremely professional and never told me to get the f**k out once.  Most Drill Sergeants would frown at his unusual kindness, they would call him weak and accuse him of being too nice to his customers. Yes, I have seen all of the hoopla on the internet, here (Yelp), and even the infamous 45-minute episode of edited snippets of money-making propaganda (Ramsey's version, mind you).  \nI did not get to meet Amy (sad face) nor did I hear her barking orders to or at anyone (this too would have given a Drill Sergeant the poopy-pants frown), but I know she was there because the food was unbelievably good (and I saw her on TV so I know she must be real). I really had no idea that it would be that good. \nSeriously, have people lost their ability to develop and conclude their \"own\" opinions through firsthand experiences, rather than that of second hand (if-even-that) information, that some TV show made (and edited) for ratings. Ratings equal money. But without further digression and like so many other \"open-minded\" people, I refuse to join or be a part of the couch-glued hate bandwagon without ever tried it out for myself, first hand. Glad we gave them a try, because they now have a new customer and new friends (without couch glue on our asses). We loved it. \nFor the rest of the people out in the world that are going to believe everything you see on TV, or maybe what you have heard from someone who heard it from someone else who saw it on their Facebook wall, Twitter feed and/or read it on Snopes (so it must be true), you truly are missing out. Had we never heard about ABC or seen the show, we probably would have never eaten there today, let alone even discovering it. \nThank you Sammy (and Amy) for your professional service and great food.

I ordered the smoke salmon flatbread and for dessert I had a candy bar pie I believe it's called. It was really good and the presentation of the food was very well put together. I didn't meet Amy however. I met Sammy and he was really nice. You can tell he means well and cares about his staff and customers. He even took a picture with my sister and her friends that she of course posted on Facebook. I wish I had it to upload to my review. My sister stayed later than I did (I had to leave to go to a concert). The owner was nice enough to offer to put my food in a fridge until my sister was ready to leave so my food didn't spoil  when I left. It is a little pricey but the food is worth it. My sister also ordered a gin and tonic. He made it very strong which she really liked. We will definitely be back.", "date": "Jan 4, 2014"},

Samy was very patient with us and didn't mind that my friends and I spent 25 minutes chatting before we ordered appetizers.   He asked my name once and called me by my name the entire evening - I give him points for that.\nHere is what many people don't understand, Samy is an old-school guy from Israel.  These old-school guys from the Middle East are very passionate, loud and animated when they talk about something important to them.  I never watched their episode of Kitchen Nightmares, but he seems like an okay guy to me.  However, I can see how others may view him as crazy when he gets into a heated discussion.

{"rating": "3 star rating", "comment": "This is when I wish Yelp offered 1/2 stars.  Yes, I admit it, we came to Phoenix to meet the people who had the epic meltdown on Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmare.  I was pleasantly surprised.\nLet me set the mood.  The restaurant is located in a shopping mall (not uncommon in Phoenix) with plenty of parking and a movie theatre next door (if people still do dinner and a movie).  The parking lot is very dimly lit, so if you have trouble seeing at night (which I do), take this into consideration.\nThe Resturant is beautiful. As you enter, you are greeted by owner Samy, who is very enthusiastic and very intense.  The restaurant is decorated as classic Italian, with a lovely photo of the couple/owners and a letter from former President George W. Bush that hung over my head.  The desert case is beautiful and filled with the most delicious cakes and pastries (more on that later).\nWe ordered the flat bread, (its huge, so don't fill up or you won't have room for the main course) which was delicious and freshly made.  We weren't offered a dipping sauce, which would have been nice.\nMy kids ordered the pizza, which was tasty, but had a light vinegar taste, which I have to assume was added and not because of bad ingredients.  All of the ingredients were fresh and nothing tasted frozen.  \nMy wife ordered the ziti which was good, but not inspired.  I would have added more garlic and salt.  I ordered the spaghetti aioli with spicy shrimp scampi.  I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner.  The pasta was lightly oiled with a nice spice and the shrimp well cooked with a good bite.  \nI know there has been talk that Amy doesn't make her deserts, but we not only saw her cooking them, we could smell it all through the restaurant.  The deserts are must and very, very good.\nSamy and Amy were very generous with their time, offering us insight into the show and their experiences since.  Although we came for \"train wreck\", we were surprised by the food.  Overall, I would say to give ABC a try and judge for yourself.", "date": "Nov 28, 2013"},

The food was actually tasty: the pear added a smooth alternate to the usual apple I have with a salad. The dressing was excellent and I believe there was a drizzle of chocolate. Unusual, but tasty. \nThe portion size seemed approximate to what you'd expect for lunch. The delivery time was appropriately speedy. It was a salad with no cooked parts, but they did well with respect to that. The presentation was appetizing. \nSammy did bring by a pizza which Gordon famously criticized. Sammy announced that it looked great, which is a little unusual, but the fact he said it make the experience a little more surreal (omg that's where Gordon sat! There's the register! Etc). He acted as host and delivered the check (a waitress took our order and delivered the food). \nI tipped 10$, hoping that it found the appropriate home (I am usually generous with my tipping anyway). \nOverall, the \"experience\" of what happened on the show still kind of exists, but the food we ordered was pretty tasty and passed the tests of my layman taste buds. \nI'd return again.", "date": "Nov 20, 2013"},

We went in and the place was a little busy. We noticed that Sammy was behind the counter and because nobody greeted us we asked if we could sit anywhere. Sammy looked directly at us, rolled his eyes and walked off. We know it was Sammy because we recognized him from the local paper/news stories. \nMy friends and I sat down and waited, and waited and waited until Sammy came over dismissing the wait by telling us how useless his staff was and that the server was running late. The other server was very busy. We ordered our drinks and they literally never came. Sammy never came back. Nobody checked on us. We sat there for a half hour. Eventually a server came on and noticed us and an hour after arrival our service began. \nWe ordered two pizzas. Now, let me tell you, I love pizza. I know pizza and I know that no pizza should take 45 minutes to cook but ours did. When it came out my friends pizza was wrong. He gets a small allergic reaction to mushrooms and this had mushrooms all over it. He brought it to the servers attention and she went back to the kitchen where we heard the lovely Miss Amy. Not only could we hear Amy calling us losers she actually stated, \"the food comes as is, no moderations, if he is allergic, he shouldn't have ordered it, take it back out.\" The server brought it back and apologized, showing us the ticket where she wrote NO MUSHROOMS. My friend decided to take a slice of mine while we waited to talk to Sammy or Amy. We got both. We explained what happened and politely asked to leave. The pizza I ordered was horrible, cold, greasy, the dough was spongey and soaked, it was awful. Sammy and Amy accused us of being Yelp employees undercover to sabotage their business and then Sammy stormed off to go do something. We saw him scribbling madly on paper and when he came back he handed us a bill that overcharged us for both of our meals. He told us that we could pay our ticket and start paying back some of the damage yelp had done or he would call the cops on us and have us arrested for theft. Amy then threatened our jobs at yelp (where we don't even work) telling us we would be arrested soon because the FBI was investigating us for blackmailing and sabotaging her work.

Samy greeted us and was very kind...I was a bit nervous (because of all of the hype) to tell him that we were just there for dessert.  He quickly showed us all of the desserts in the case.  It was hard to decide.  I went with the Chocolate Caramel Tart and my best friend went for the flourless German Chocolate cake.  \nWe chose to stay and eat and Samy showed us to our table and brought us some ice waters.  Amy came out to look at the desserts and told us both hello with a smile.\nSamy brought us our desserts and they were DELICIOUS.  They were both VERY rich in flavor...the kind of rich where you know you are not going to be able to finish it.  So we took more than half of it home...which I can't wait to revisit again later! \nAfter looking at the menu, the best friend and I decided that we will definitely be going back to try some of the pizza and pasta dishes they have to offer. \nBoth Samy and Amy were very kind.  I am a very honest and loyal Yelper, so I hope those of you who read this, see that and take this review for what it is.  A true representation of the visit to ABC that my best friend and I experienced on a lovely Friday afternoon.\nAs we left, Amy thanked us, as did Samy and we were off!\nI admit, I did follow all of the drama, but I am the type that needs to judge things for myself...and this was one of those places that I am glad I chose to visit and see what I would experience!", "date": "Oct 11, 2013"},

We were able to look at the gorgeous dessert case and we picked two flourless items::  German Chocolate torte and a white chocolate/chocolate mousse.  OMG these were the BEST gluten free desserts I have ever had, and that same thought was echoed around the table.  The German Chocolate was a such a treat, the coconut was delish!  The mousse was so rich and decadent!  We were not able to finish these two desserts and they gladly boxed them up so we could eat the rest the next day.  Everyone else in the group got a coffee or drink made by Sammy and they were very pleased.  We are still talking about those desserts two days later and can't wait to go back and try more!!!

The front of the house was beautiful with an array of desserts on display. Sadly, this is where the good experience stopped.  The ONLY positive to come out of this experience was our server, whom I sympathize (I work in the restaurant business). We started off with the Lemon Garlic hummus ($5) only to learn that it did not come with bread...What?? It was okay at best, pretty bland. \nImmediately after our app arrived we ordered the Pear Salad ($12), 18' BBQ Chicken Mango Pizza ($22) and the Tomato Spinach Ravioli ($14). Our food seemed to be taking a while and I decided to ask the manager/owner Samy how much longer it would take. Wrong decision. He was short-tempered and dismissive, saying it would be \"right out\". A total of 70 minutes and one app later our food FINALLY arrived (the dining room was nearly empty, maybe 4-5 other tables). It was not worth the wait...\nThe salad was fine, the dressing was sickeningly sweet. The ravioli was swimming in a bland tomato cream sauce and I could tell the ravioli were NOT fresh. The pizza was completely raw and the chicken was dry/tasteless. Our server was almost embarrassed for serving us this food, gave us a knowing glance when we told her we were unhappy and removed the food from the table.\nMy friends and I left feeling not only dissatisfied and hungry, but uncomfortable. Throughout our dinner, the \"chef\"/owner (wouldn't know it by her behavior) was heard complaining, yelling and picking on her staff. Horrible. We will never be back.", "date": "Sep 21, 2013"},

Don't like to give restaurants a bad review because, being a chef, I know it's a hard business.\nThe old man in the cashier, which I assume is the owner, is really observant...in a creepy way. He watches you eat, watches you as you read the bill, continues to watch as you pay, asks you if you will leave any tip...etc\nIt just makes the entire experience of eating in a restaurant VERY awkward. There's also really loud music. However, the place looks great. It's really pretty and the desserts look unbelievable. Reminds me of high-end patisserie.\nI'm a burger person, so I ordered their burger with blue cheese. I don't quite understand what happens when you take a bite off that burger... The flavors work so wrong together. That truffle oil just kills everything else in the burger. The bun was very well toasted, so I gotta give them that. However, I literally had two bites and sent it back. Not good at all.\nMy boyfriend had a cesar salad and it was... The lettuce was not crispy. It didn't taste like cesar salad, it just tasted like a bland aioli with no salt. Also, very greasy. \nFelt very tempted for their desserts and ordered the flourless chocolate cake. I'm gonna be honest here, it was fantastic. Now, just by looking at the menu, tasting the food, analizing the owner.. The desserts just didn't match. Maybe they have a different chef for their desserts? Who knows, could be!\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody in the area. Its very pretty, but that's about it.

{"rating": "3 star rating", "comment": "I love Gordon Ramsay! I came here a couple weeks ago for an early dinner with my friends more out of curiosity than anything. \nFood: \nLox Smoked Salmon Salad: egh. Not worth the $14 -- 4 slices of lox, a crustini and greens topped with a dressing that was not very good. I also bit into something really hard and unidentifiable that completely turned me off. I did not have another bite after that. \nVegetarian Mediterranean Pizza: It had spicy peppers, red onions, roasted red peppers, artichoke hearts, basil pesto, feta and mozzarella on it. I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. It was just the right amount of heat, and I liked the combination of the veggies and sauces. Crust wasn't anything special, but overall, a good pizza.\nChocolate Ganache/Mousse cake: TO DIE FOR! Gordan Ramsay had this cake on the show, and it was the one thing he actually liked. It was amaaaazing. So rich and just the right amount of sweetness/slight bitterness of the chocolate. Love, love, love! I ordered one of these to take home too. A bit pricey at $10, but worth it for a once in a while treat. \nService: \nSamy was very polite -- I do appreciate that he is really trying his hardest to give good customer service. So I was content with the service. He greeted us warmly and was very courteous the entire night. Our waitress was nice too. I was a little put off that she was trying to sell us shirts at the end of the dinner though....lol I don't know I just thought that was a bit forward. The only glimpse of Amy I saw was her scurrying about in the kitchen in the back. \nOverall: \nNot a bad experience. Definitely a bit too pricey and the question still remains as to whether all the desserts, including the one I loved, were actually made on-site, but who knows. They're trying their best to recover from the shit show they portrayed on Kitchen Nightmares, and from what we experienced, it seems like a big improvement.", "date": "Sep 15, 2013"},

The pastries looks UNBELIEVABLY delicious!!!  If I wasn't trying to lose weight I would have eaten everything in the case.  I had a caprese salad which was fine, but it was July which, to me, means that the tomatoes should be amazing - these tomatoes looked and tasted like they were bought at Safeway and never really ripened.

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "WHY WE DECIDED TO GIVE THE PLACE A TRY:\nOk, so I was on a Netflix binge watching Kitchen Nightmares. I watched the first two seasons and decided to search online for Gordon Ramsey. The first result that popped up was Amy's Baking Company right here in my home town of Scottsdale AZ. \nSo, I watched the episode online like and then proceeded to watch all the local news and radio interviews of ABC. \nNext, I decided to give the place a try for myself before I placed final judgment (something I think everyone should do with the ability to think for themselves).\nTHE FOOD REVIEW:\nMy wife and I went for our Friday night dinner and started with the flat bread... It tasted amazing! It was seasoned perfectly, with Italian seasoning and oil. The bottom was flakey and crispy and the top was a beautiful golden brown.\nWe ordered the same things that were criticized on the show. I ordered a Blue ribbon burger medium and my wife ordered a small fig pizza.\nThere was a little bit of a wait for the entrees but I have never eaten somewhere with this quality of food where there wasn't at least this long of a wait for the entree. \nWhen the main course did arrive, they both came to the table at the same time and were perfectly cooked. The pizza crust  was golden brown on on top and crispy on the bottom. There were fresh ingredients and extra stretchy mozzarella on top! I was honestly afraid to try the pizza cause I was figuring there would be a fig paste similar to Fig Newtons on the pizza, that was not the case at all. There were fresh chunks of fig sprinkled on the pizza. It was very tasty and this is coming from a pepperoni only guy. \nAs for the Blue Ribbon burger; I thought the taste was great. The pilled high toppings of cheese, mushrooms, and bacon were great. The burger had a very peppery flavor, which I happen to really like. The outside of the burger was seared to have a smokey grilled flavor and the inside was lightly pink and filled with juice. \nThe only complaint about the burger was the bun. It fell apart on me before I could finish it, but this wasn't a deal breaker for me.\nI also got the sweet potato fries with ranch. The fries tasted good, and had a great flakey, crispy, outer crust on them. \nTHE PRICE:\nEverything on the menu is separated. Sammie said this was done to let the customer pick and choose what they want without paying for things they don't want. \nFor example, if you want flat bread with hummus you have to order them separately for $5 each.\nIf you want the burger and fries you have to order them separately. $15 for the burger and $5 for the fries.\nVERDICT:\nThis is one of the best local restaurants my wife and I have eaten at here in the valley. We plan to make this a regular spot for our dinner dates (it's also in the same parking lot at a movie theater so it's perfect for movie nights). \nGive them a try before bashing them because of what you saw on TV. \nNOTE ON THE REALITY TV ASPECT:\nI personally work in the video production business and have a good idea of what happens behind the scenes at these \"reality\" tv shows. Just like scripted tv, \"reality\" TV needs drama to sell. I do believe that the owner has trouble accepting criticism, but I also feel that many things were exaggerated and egged on by the producers of this show. Even so, these people have been put through the fire and have not given up. They have only made changes for the positive regarding the waitstaff and tips.", "date": "Aug 5, 2013"},

We went on a Saturday at 7 pm and wasn't very busy (there was another table doing dinner, and one doing desserts). The service was good, although a bit excessive. It was almost like they were anticipating that we wouldn't enjoy the experience, so they overcompensate and all our interactions had a sort of sense of uneasiness. Samy was very friendly and nice to us. We didn't interact with Amy, but another table asked to take a picture with her, and she seemed happy to come out of the kitchen to do it. \nOur server asked us what our nationality was. We're US citizens....it was a somewhat awkward question to ask, and she just wanted to find out if we were Chinese so she could show off her saying \"I love you\" in Mandarin...\nWe ordered the meatballs, the caprese salad, flatbread, and 2 pizzas. Everything was generally up to standard. The pizzas are thin crust, and were crispy. I really enjoyed the Fig & Prosciutto Pizza, it was amazing. We also had the asparagus pizza, which was good, but was a little bit salty for my taste. The flatbread is pretty much a pizza crust with some seasonings and herbs.\nFor dessert,  we ordered chocolate mousse and something else, it was like a chocolate pie with toffee and edible glitter on top.

I fully admit, I loved the train wreck of an episode that was Kitchen Nightmares, but my 11 year old little girl loved it more and begged to go to this place on our next visit out.  I am working on Mom of the Year so I took her (haha). \nMy 8 year old son was with us.  My sis, her man and his daughter came as well.  THREE kids and according to Yelp this is NOT a good place for kids... gulp!  We were there on July 16 early eve.  I will start with the restaurant and I have not a bad thing to say.  It was clean and it was gorgeous.  The menu was surprising.  For a non-kids place, the menu listed a kiddie pasta dish for $5.  Fabulous!  Our waitress seemed to be making up for the past crazy by being OVERLY sugary sweet.  At first it was nice, but honestly, it got annoying.  \nWe started with hummus and some dipping bread.  This was absolutely delicious.  We also ordered a pepperoni pizza, a ham and cheese Panini, a Caesar salad and the kids pasta.  The food was fairly timely.  Had we no children, I don't think there would have been a rush, but bored kids really emphasize how long it takes to get food in a restaurant.  I am happy to say that all of the food was very good.  My son did not like the pasta, but my sister's BF loved it.  I did send it back to get doctored up with some sauce, and there seemed to be no freaking out in the kitchen over this debacle.  Unfortunately, my son still turned his nose up at it.  I think the problem is that it is a little fancy for a high percentage of kids that are likely used to Prego.  Don't judge me!  That infamous Caesar that was featured on TV was very good.  I think if you read the menu, you won't be surprised.  It actually spelled out what was in the salad so I knew what I was going to be getting.  The pizza was AWESOME and the Panini was very good.  The girls ordered desserts and not only were they gorgeous but they really were wonderful.  Amy even offers a flourless chocolate cake that is gluten-free.  \nThe BEST part was that Amy was very VERY nice to the little girls.  My daughter REALLY wanted to meet Amy.  Not only did she get to meet her, but Amy actually chatted with the kids and took a photo with them.  But she didn't stop there.  She gave the kids some plastic \"Hello Kitty\" rings.\nI was out in Scottsdale for a visit.  I don't live there.  However, if I did, I WOULD occasionally frequent this place.  If absolutely for nothing else, the dessert case is spectacular and I really don't care who is baking.  And parents!  Put your minds at rest.

She should not be running a business, let alone one in the food industry where you need thick skin.  \nHere's a tip.  Don't keep people waiting for food, especially if it's mediocre.

Opposite this is the neighboring Pita Jungle which is 6 doors down from ABC. Pita Jungle is always packed to capacity at all times of day. Pita jungle does not require reservations and is very reasonable in price. Conversely, ABC requires reservations even if it is completely empty. I think this place is a front not a real restaurant. It is very strange.  \nThere are pastries visible in the pastry case. I think they are made by Nick's  or AJ's.  I just don't think they make them here because they only have single servings of several pastries.  It would not be possible to make single servings like they display in the assortment they have and never have a customer to eat them.  In other words these pastries are bought and not made in house.

I was in my hotel room (thinking about just ordering room service), when someone I knew had posted a comment about the Kitchen Nightmare episode on FB. I then decided to look up the episode on HULU (this was not long after airing), then realizing I was not far from there, I decided to go. Uggg... I could tell just walking in that the kitchen was in distress. The old guy was sweating like a fat man in a marathon behind the touch screen computer. He had several tickets in his hand, and was having trouble with the technology. There were shouts from the back and a lot of loud banging from the kitchen. I noticed only one table had their entr\u00e9e. That table seem unimpressed with their food. one other table got some appetizer shortly after I was seated, I heard one person remark \"will I have to wait another 45min for my dinner\" The time frame got my attn., because it looked like a simple pita and hummus type appetizer.The old man responded curtly to this comment but with his accent I could not understand what he said. When he left the table, the group kinda snickered. There were like 2-3 other groups/couples waiting that just had drinks. My waitress was very polite, and attentive she kept my glass full. I noticed she stayed away from a couple tables, until someone asked her to fill their water glass. She did as asked, and the old man noticed and scolded her telling her that they were HIS customers, and she is NOT to serve them. Even when the customer tried to explain to him that he just wanted some water, the old man responded \"You do not tell me how to run my business! I am the boss here you are not.. if you want water you have to come through me, not her...\" I then realized why she avoided those tables. My order was taken... I ordered the Chicken Parm. \nI waited for a while, even though I fully intended to, I forgot to mark the time I placed my order, but it seemed like an eternity when I did start clocking (I imagine 15-20min later) still the waitress was kind, and kept my glass full. about 30 min later the old man placed and Eggplant Parm in front of me. He was still sweaty, and had some strong odors about him. At this point my sense of humor was thin, and when he placed the wrong dish in front of me I called him on the fact that I was her customer and not his. He argued with me insisting that he took my order for an Eggplant Parm. The table kinda caddy corner from me actually got up, and informed him that THEY had ordered that dish over an hour ago, and that they herd me order the Chicken parm. The old man continued to argue till the waitress had to confirm my order with the original hand written ticket. I will say at that point, the old man said \"I am sorry, but you know how it is... it is confusing...\" The other customer and I rolled our eyes he sat at his table with his wife (who had no food in front of her) and I returned to waiting. Well I got my meal the same time the other gentleman's wife got hers - about 15min later. \nMy meal was an undercooked chicken that was supposed to be baked, but somehow was greasy. and when I mean undercooked, the thick part of the chicken was RAW, BLOODY RAW! It was NOT crispy the breading was soggy, mostly from the weird pasta situation. It looked as if they used a non slotted spoon to pull the pasta from the pot, because there was A LOT of water on my plate. and I am not sure the physics behind this, but somehow, they managed to have both overcooked and undercooked pasta on my plate. As if they cooked left over pasta, with new (dry) noodles! Some of the pasta was like mush, and some of it was crunchy. This meal could have killed me had I eaten it!\nThe other couple was served the Eggplant Parm, then 15 min later she was served (I think it was a salad ) As a gentleman would, he did not start his meal till his wife was served. When they started eating the wife threw her fork on the plate and said, I can't take another bite of this $%!+ ! The husbands eyes and mine caught each others. He came to my table with his plate in hand. He asked me to taste his Eggplant Parm. I tried to cut his Eggplant Parm, but it was REAL tough, I managed to get a small piece, and it tasted like dirt - literally! We both took our complaint to the old man, and he started arguing with us concerning the quality of his food. I pointed out the blood, he said \"Good! Hope it kills you, then you will never bother me again\". The other couple slipped out, didn't pay the check (don't blame them) but that left me - the old man insisted that I not only pay my tab, but the other couples too. I pulled out a $20, threw it on the table and left! I was chased out the restaurant by both of them. I went to the Pita Jungle and had a much more positive experience there (The other couple was there when I arrived with a full meal in front of them.

We started with garlic herb'd flatbread, golden brown and cooked to perfection. We later dined on the BBQ chicken mango pizza with fresh avocado. It was unanimously delicious. The crust was crisp and golden even in the middle which is a challenge with thin crust pizzas with several toppings.\n The fetuccini alfredo was good and the chicken was moist and tender.\n My mother had the eggplant parmesan which was equally good.

Wow, to die for deserts! Heavenly!\nThe only constructive criticism I would have, was that not all of the food came out at the same time.

Since we had already eaten, we decided to order meatballs and the jalapeno artichoke dip.  WOW what a disappointment.  The meatballs were dense and dry.  The dip tasted like a block of cream cheese was dumped in a bowl and jalapenos were placed on top.  the one saving grace was the bread they served with the dip.  It was perfectly crisp and flavorful.  Since there was an amazing display of desserts close to the entrance, we decided to split one for the table.  It was incredible!. Rich..delicious and amazing.  The problems really started once we received our bill...Six people, two appetizers and desert and 3 drinks and 3 extremely small Irish coffees..91 dollars!!! We questioned our waitress on why the irish coffees the men ordered were twelve dollars each, she immediately asked if we wanted to see the owner.  We said sure.  When I politely asked why the coffee was so expensive, I was asked by Sammy to tell him a fair  price.  When my husband did, he was told to get the f out. Amy, almost on cue, started recording us with her cell phone.  We said it was ridiculous but we would just pay and leave.  Sammy became immediately irate and told us to pay and get the f out.  My friend, who recently had a baby, had to go to the restroom before we left.  As I was standing outside the restroom door, Amy begins to scream at me \" why are you still here\" \"Get the F out you Fing c***\"  I said did you seriously just call a customer that you have the balls to charge $90 to a C****.  I told her again that I thought half of the food was great but she only wanted to listen to the negative.  A woman came out of the kitchen and said \"please just go\" I said I would...once my friend was out of the restroom but I liked some of what we had and did not understand such a vicious attack on a customer. Amy  then called me a tramp and said she was calling the police. I said, well I don't understand how you can call a customer such names while you take their money.

The tart, or pie, as it was, underneath a mountain of whipped topping was supposed to be white chocolate. It was curdled and had zero flavor. The graham cracker crust was not as good as a store bought version, very pedestrian. It basically had no flavor, and appeared to be at least 3 days old. I had one bite, took the rest home, and threw it in the garbage. The coffee- what there was of it- very good. The atmosphere- tense and stressful. The bill? over $15.00. I will never, I mean NE-VER return. RIP, ABC!", "date": "Jul 6, 2013"},

{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "I came Arizona during vacation, and while I was there, I stopped by at ABC.\nWorst decision ever made.\nWe came in on a Friday night, usually the busiest time for a restaurant, and there were probably 3 to 4 table there. We got taken to our seats, where a server greeted us. The service was very nice, but the wait wasn't. We ordered the meatball pizza and for a restaurant that had 3 tables there, we waited for nearly 40 minutes; way too long for a pizza. \nThen you would think 40 minutes would be enough time to cook a pizza properly, no, it comes out completely raw. I sent it back and they told me that they would make another one. That one wasn't much better either. This was a little more cooked, but still, raw. Even worse, aside from being raw, the pizza tasted terrible. The meatball was as dense as anything, and the cheese was oily and hard, and the whole thing just had a nasty after taste. By then, I decided to stop trying.\nSo I asked for a bill. What's the worst part was they charged be double for sending the pizza back. Do not come to this place. Not only is their food nasty, but for the same money i spent, i could've bought 3 pizza's and Pizza Hut.  \nGo to any other restaurant, but here. I'm dead serious, this is the absolute worst restaurant I've been to. Just don't even think about coming here. Oh well, looking at the number of tables when i was there, it seems they won't be open for long.", "date": "Jul 3, 2013"},

I'd seen the \"Kitchen Nightmares\" episode, and if for no other reason, was curious to see if it was indeed as bad as the show had portrayed it.\nIt wasn't very busy. There were probably two or three other parties there when we were. We waited just a little while, but not too long to place our order. When we did, Sammy was very nice. He gave us his personal recommendation for the meatball pizza.\nWe only waited about 10 to 15 minutes before our pizza was out and on the table. It wasn't an hour long horror story like I've seen others on here write. The pie was nice and hot. when it arrived.\nThe pizza itself wasn't that bad, but certainly not the best I've ever had. I thought the crust was a bit too thin, and would've liked it to either be more crispy if it was that thin, or just a little thicker. I also thought there was a just a touch too much garlic on the pizza, but it was still not bad.\nIt was quite the experience. I thought it was a little weird that the servers couldn't handle money or take our order, but they could fill our water and bring our food out, but if that's what works for Sammy and Amy, then that's what works.\nOverall, not as bad as portrayed on the show.

So, here are my thoughts:\nI had a light drink with their glazed seared salmon salad and some garlic-y flatbread appetizers. I like the fact that they were trying to go organic and include fresh options. However, I wish the salmon was not overcooked, and the honey citrus glaze had a funky after-taste I'm not sure what is up with that.\nTheir desserts did look appetizing, but I did not have room for that. \nConclusions: I'm not a big fan of their food, there was an uncomfortable confrontation at the front house, very odd and unsettling environment yet I do like the d\u00e9cor and a \"try\" for fresh ingredients towards their Italian-style dishes, but I was expecting more of a baking restaurant than anything.

The only problem is I finished it in just a couple bites (probably 250 calories per bite, but what do you expect?!)\nWe had the Mediterranean pizza. It was good, not great, but plenty good to not complain about it. Yes, it was cooked just fine--no raw dough. Not nearly as good as some of the other pizza joints in the Valley like Spinatos \nhttp://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Spinatos+Pizza&find_loc=Phoenix%2C+AZ&ns=1),\n but very good nonetheless.\nSammy, the owner, was watching everything like a hawk. He had the waiters and bus boys moving around like a drill sergeant would. They seemed slightly scared and insecure. I probably would not have noticed it had I not seen the show, but because of the show I was on heightened alert.

The inside of the restaurant is nice although there is a line of mirrors and sconces on the back wall that are hung crooked and that was a little distracting for my OCD. The volume on the music is up too loud to have any sort of conversation without yelling across the table and around 8pm they dim the lights so low I had a hard time seeing anything at all. \nThe servers are friendly, they say they are now receiving their tips although there is no telling how true that is so I suggest giving them cash separate from however you decide to pay your bill.\nAs soon as we walked in we were asked whether we wanted dinner or dessert, if you aren't sure you'd better get sure quickly because they don't give you time to make a decision. We opted for dinner (won't make that mistake again). The list of appetizers is a joke, your options are a bowl of salted olives, eight different kinds of hummus - you have to order the bread separately - or artichoke/jalapeno dip (the dip comes with what they call pita bread but is really pizza dough). We ordered our entrees and appetizer at the same time, the artichoke/jalapeno dip since it was the only one that comes with bread and for the entrees, the ham and brie panini and the lemon chicken panini. 45 minutes later we got our appetizer, none of the flavors go together (unless maybe you're stoned out of your mind and all you had to eat was pizza crust, artichoke hearts, olive oil and jalapeno paste then I guess it could be considered a creative take on gnosh-worthy food), wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten but I wouldn't want to eat it again ever. Another 45 minutes later our sandwiches made their way out.... it takes a special lack of talent to mess up a sandwich. The lemon chicken was more than \"EEW\" worthy. The ham & brie was about as bland as cardboard but a lot more greasy.   I cannot say enough about how gross the bread was, supposedly they make it there but truly I don't care where they make it, it still tastes awful.  \nOverall, service is slow but at least the servers are friendly.

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "Some amateur cooks try to cover up poor quality ingredients with strong-flavored sauces and toppings. Too many pungent flavors--like garlic aoli, truffle oil, & bleu cheese--piled on an undercooked piece of meat makes for an oily, foul-tasting mess. Same goes for pizza with pulled pork, BBQ sauce and apples--too many sweet, cloying flavors with no contrast. \nRepeated complaints about undercooked food indicate the food (including the pizza) is frozen and not thawed properly. On the menu, the phrase \"freshly sauteed chicken breast\" is repeated three times, so the chicken is probably pre-cooked and frozen. Many of the sauces are overly sweet with the main ingredient of preserved fruit that came out of a jar. ABC claims to be vegetarian friendly, but doesn't make substitutions because nothing is cooked to order. A lot of the food resembles cafeteria slop because the cook has no sense of proportion or balance and all the ingredients are canned or frozen. The prices are ridiculous for industrial strength food, as is charging extra for parmesan cheese, bread, or drink refills.

I can say that I ordered the same burger as Chef Ramsay did, and it was pretty much an identical experience. The burger just leaked out juice and was completely soggy/wet and overall disgusting. It has become evident to me that these people did not learn their lesson from Chef Ramsay, and sorry to say, I will NEVER come back here in my life.

I can cook a burger better than her on my BBQ. These people own a pretty fancy kitchen and couldn't bother to deliver a quality burger worthy of the price. IT WAS PRACTICALLY RAW!!!\nDo yourself  a favor. Avoid your curiosity of this place, and just stay away. I think they are getting a lot of business from being on the show, but it's not worth your money wasted honestly. If they had any ounce of self respect and honesty, they'd change things, but it's clear they haven't. Avoid this place, save your money.

We were very excited to see firsthand if the rumors were true.\nDespite watching the implosion on Kitchen Nightmares, this place exceeded our expectations. In short, the food was good quality, the desserts were delicious, and there was very little, if any drama as depicted on the show.\nFood:\nWe ordered a lemon hummus with flatbread appetizer for the table, which was inhaled. We also shared an organic chicken pizza with mushrooms, mozzarella, and basil pesto, and a slice chocolate cr\u00e8me brulee pie. \nThe pizza was delicious and cooked to our liking - the crust was a little on the soft side, but fine - definitely not undercooked. The cr\u00e8me brulee pie also didn't last very long in front of us.\nService:\nThis was the one area that might have needed some improvement. Sometimes, it felt like every waiter came to our table. At other times, it was nearly impossible to get somebody's attention (or for them to follow through on a request). The situation seemed a little tense, but without knowing the history of this restaurant, it's something that might have been slightly annoying, but not enough to ruin the overall experience.\nThe staff is likely very new and may not have time to learn how to work well together. Also, when they took our credit card, the check took a while to come back. When our waiter returned, (s)he said that the owner wouldn't allow the server to return the check - and that another server would do it. (Huh?) The server seemed to understand the absurdity of this situation.\nThe Owners:\nSammy was very involved in the overall dining experience, checking on waiters. He seemed concerned about making a good impression. We didn't see Amy come out of the kitchen, although we did catch a glimpse of her upon leaving. Sammy was also very happy to take pictures with customers.\nOverall:\nA perfectly acceptable dining experience. The food we ordered would have met our expectations for the type of establishment it seeks to be.

{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "I have got to say in the food service business you experience many different ways a business is ran, and I have got to say that this restaurant is one of the most dysfunctional I have ever ate at. From the kitchen I saw and heard Amy yelling and degrading her staff. When I sent my food back I could here from the kitchen \" whats wrong now\" and the owner Amy had the nerve to peer around the corner and give me a not so nice look as if I had, disgraced her family or something. I went with an open mind and the owners closed it real quick. The tv show didn't show half of it and I hope that they will leave my town and set up shop somewhere communism is ok, but its not here in America. So Amy and Sammy please just vacate so that space can be used for someone who knows how to run a restaurant cause the two of you obviously don't. Never eat there again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1", "date": "Jun 9, 2013"},
{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "Like one of the last reviewers, I am not paid and this review is honest based on my experience tonight. I'm from California, but I went to Amy's Baking Co. while visiting my mother who lives in Fountain Hills. We were skeptical at first and you can tell when you enter the restaurant that the show has had a major impact on the place. Nevertheless, the food and service were both top-notch. Perhaps they're compensating for the negativity generated by the show, but I will certainly be going back for the food--which was delicious.\nWe arrived when they were opening and were the first customers of the night. We were greeted by a waiter who asked us if we would like a dessert or were there for a meal. We told him that we were there for a meal and he sat us. We were quickly approached by a waitress that took our drink order. When questioned, she indicated that it was her third day.\nI ordered a burger without some of the dressings that normally come on it. Samy came over to clarify my order, so I think he is still in exclusive control of the POS system. We ended up having a conversation and he was nothing but nice the whole time. The burger came after about 10 or 15 minutes. It was fantastic--exactly how I ordered it, fresh, and made of what tasted like high-quality beef.\nSamy and the waitress checked in with us regularly to make sure we were enjoying our meal. My mother and I both complimented the food, which we were honestly enjoying. Amy came out and waved and told us \"Thank you\" and that she was glad we were enjoying the experience. It was pretty cool of them.\nWe paid up, Samy shook our hands, and we left to go see a movie next door. We went back after the movie for dessert. I ordered a cake that had candy and an oreo cookie crust. It is one of the best cakes I've ever had (at least top five). I strongly recommend ABC and I intend to go back next time I'm in town.", "date": "Jun 8, 2013"},
{"rating": "4 star rating", "comment": "\"Are we REALLY doing this?\" That was my thought as I parked my car. A bunch of us were getting together for a friend's going away and it was decided to have it at Amy's Baking Company. I'll preface this by saying that I hadn't heard about Amy's until it made the news after the whole Gordon Ramsay debacle. \nSo after playing catch up and fulling understanding the buzz it was with more than a little trepidation that I walked through the door. I immediately liked the atmosphere and the music they were playing.\nI was welcomed by our server Debbie and ordered the Bleu Ribbon burger. While my meal was being prepared we were well looked after by the staff who made sure that our water and sodas were full.\nWhen my Bleu Ribbon Burger arrived, it was HUGE, cooked up a perfect medium rare topped with bleu cheese and bits of bacon with a home made bun that was heavenly. The bun was actually a little too big but it was so good that I had to make the choice of finishing off the bun or trying to save room for dessert. I opted for Plan B\nThis is the SAME burger that Gordon Ramsay trashed (which I saw on You Tube). So unless these guys COMPLETELY changed up the preparation of this item I honestly don't know what Mr.Ramsay was flipping out about. It came with a nice side salad and I got a side of fries which were good. I really enoyed it and it was a LOT of food.\nTheir dessert display is VERY impressive and everything looks delicious. While my favorite Key Lime pie of all time is still Chelsea's Kitchen, these guys serve up a good too. I also got to try their mousse which was delicious and their candy bar pie (or cake? Not sure, I think I was slipping into a diabetic coma at this point) was \"eyes roll back in your head\" good.\nThe staff were all very welcoming and gracious and Sammy made sure we were enjoying everything. And they were absolute SAINTS for splitting our bill 14 ways. So this really was an enjoyable night and I think everyone in our group was very pleasantly surprised.  I have to to admit that after reading the reviews and hearing all of the chatter I didn't know what I was in for. But I had a great meal and experience and would not hesitate to come back here again if I were in the area.", "date": "Jun 8, 2013"},

We went to say goodbye to our friend who is moving to DC & to do what us yelpers do best, try something new, eat, drink & write a review!\nWe were greeted by the infamous Sammy who in minutes accomodated our request for numerous tables to seat our group of which most had yet to arrive! I told him of my admiration of the pretty chandeliers,& decor of the restaurant, he responded in kind about their food, complimented his wife and gave me a hug! Yes surprised me too! \nIn a daze I moved on distracted by the display of several desserts. I was greeted by Amy who when I told her I loved the desserts sprinkled in edible glitter & she cracked a joke, then complimented my friend's shirt! \nWe were seated & greeted by our friendly server Debbie with water & drinks quickly filled, & refilled faster than we could drink by more friendly servers. After finally deciding I attempted to order the Salmon Burger but was informed it wasn't available, disappointed I quickly selected  the portabella mushroom burger. Debbie was quicker to inform me that it was a mushroom not really a burger in case I wasn't aware, a misconception she said had frequently been made by others(secrets out I thought the same thing lol) pays to read but I went with it anyway! My friend and I agreed to do a split & share to try each others selection, she ordered a lemon chicken panini, crispy on the outside tender and soft on the inside. Both were tasty, although after tasting mine I regretted not keeping it all for myself, who knew a mushroom posing as a burger could taste so good!  After gazing at the display case we agreed to share a dessert, the candybar topped, layered in cream, filled with mousse, sitting on a pie shaped brownie and yes to my delight sprinkled in edible glitter! We were quick to make it a disappear, glitter and all!\nWe enjoyed an evening of good food, and great service!!\nDespite what you may have heard or read about Amy's, may I suggest trying it for yourselves, you might be as I was pleasantly surprised!\nThank you Amy's Baking Company for a memorable & delightful evening!", "date": "Jun 8, 2013"},

I went to the counter to ask for another (completely with a very calm demeanor, I have worked retail for over 7 years I know how to ask politely) and he shouted at me worse than I have ever been yelled at. \nA very aggressive woman came out after hearing the commotion, and i kid you not, after waiting for food for two hours and asking incredibly politely to have the pizza cooked some more, and began to say how I was the scum of the earth and how I should \"eat the dog food I was use to eating\" I refused to pay the bill.

The pizza was also undercooked, very much like raw dough. The pork tasted also like frozen, and the BBQ sauce made it too sweet, like a dessert item. Apples on it did not help.

Hoping that all this media hype was false. \nLet me start by saying the staff (waitress & other staff) were really personable and very attentive.

I cannot speak to the quality of the entree's. We did however try an appetizer and two desserts.  \nAppetizer - Artichoke jalape\u00f1o cream cheese with herb flat bread:\nThe flat bread was crispy and flavorful, the dip was served cold (I think it was supposed to be cold but it didn't say that on the menu.) The jalape\u00f1o's where in a bunch on the side of the dip and required mixing. The combo of the bread and the dip was decent, it didn't knock my socks off but it had okay flavor. \nDesserts - Key Lime pie & Chocolate Mousse torte: \nThe key lime filling tasted good, the crumb crust was slightly burnt. The crust ruined the pie for me. \nThe chocolate mousse torte (I think that is what it was called) was not bad at all. It was a little overpriced at $10 but  it was the best thing we ate that evening.\nWe didn't see any craziness from the owners while we ate and the place was pretty busy.

The prices were a little on the expensive side so be prepared for that if you go for the full meal deal. \nFYI: To folks w/small children: We had no trouble coming in with a stroller  but when we went to leave we were ushered out the back door.

I didn't want to go right away, and I felt it was my duty to go with an open mind.  The anticipation slowly built like the 1st time I was a wingman in a no-win situation - or the 1st time I tried fried ants in Brazil... but I digress.\nWe arrived to a semi-busy dining area, and were immediately greated by Samy.  After sitting down and placing drink orders, I noticed that there was only one waitress for all the tables, with a swarm of young drones refilling drinks and running food to and fro.  Occasionally I would hear the bell ring and giggle to myself.  Thrice I saw Amy appear, only to peer at the crowd whilst mean mugging, and multiple times I saw Samy yell orders / nudge employees / dictate demands to the poor drones.  This got progressively worse as more and more people arrived, ultimately filling the inside of the restaurant.\nThe waitress did the best she could, even at full capacity it appeared as if she was the only one taking orders, and so from a service perspective, I can't fault the employees - they did the best they could.  We weren't starving, but wanted to try an appetizer - which surprisingly was quite tasty.  We got the artichoke / jalapeno dip with flatbread.  The flatbread was fully cooked, had a good flavor, and although the dip was cold, it was a nice compliment.  We also ordered a couple of their desserts, the key lime pie and the flourless chocolate.  The crust of the key lime was overcooked, but outside of that the only comment I have about the desserts is that if you're going to charge ten bucks per item, you should probably let people know so that they're not surprised when they get the bill.\nAll of the people around us seemed to enjoy their food, and the presentation for most of it really looked nice.  We all know that the food, while maybe the most important element, isn't the only one when deciding where to spend our hard earned money.  So, in my opinion, the food isn't the problem here.  When a dining experience becomes stressful, it's just not worth it.  We DID tip the waitress, but did so outside of the bill to ensure the owners didn't get their greedy paws on it.\nI am not a hater, I am not a cyber-bully - but I call it like I see it - and my opinion is you just can't fix crazy.

Despite numerous attempts using both our names, we were never able to get a response.\nMind you, this was an advertised event.  I find it deplorable and inexcusable that a service-based establishment would advertise an event and then completely and utterly fail to respond or provided support to that event.\nUnfortunately, this review was meant to be an unbiased and truthful relation of our experience at the oft-malingered bistro, but that didn't happen. Instead, the review is being written to show our actual experience with what seems to be nothing more than contempt for customers. They advertised an event, and then completely and utterly failed to respond to any inquiries about the event by any means listed.

Fiance's  pepperoni pizza was really good.  My 11 year old son's salad came with onions in it when I asked for it with no onions and his entree followed about 2 minutes later and (I timed this part) 13 minutes before our pizza. His pasta was simple olive oil, parmesan cheese and garlic - it was cold!  Also, my fiance's soda came with ice when he explicitly asked for no ice.  And that is the real problem...our dinner including tip was $105.  For $35/person you expect attention to details and excellent customer service. The deserts were $10 a piece and were REALLY good - I think she may indeed make them as the flourless chocolate cake had \"Meow\" written on them (I got one that said \"Love\" and really wanted one that said \"Meow\" - I totally would have taken a picture of that).  The service was subpar at best.  I told my fiance that if the price had been half as much as it was and the egg was left out of the pizza I might have felt that it was OK.

Just to see what it's like. Why not? I'm in the area. I wanted to see what all the drama was about. And it was after the \"grand re-opening\". \nThe place is spotlessly clean, I mean you could eat off the floors. I was actually impressed how clean it was. And empty. Quietly empty. I guess it was because it was lunch, but it was still unnerving. \nAfter being seated the nice middle aged women got us our drinks and took our order. She seemed really nervous and scared, and after seeing the notorious Sammy watching her like a hawk, I can see why. \nAfter this, all the issues began.\nWe got the expected long wait to get our food. I wasn't in any hurry, but at least it got to me before I starved to death. I ordered a pizza, my friend got a hamburger. My pizza was okay, the crust was a little hard, but it was good. My friends hamburger/slider was rarer that she said she wanted, but ate it anyway. It was okay, passable at the best. \nSince both of us thought that the meal wasn't that bad, we decided to order the \"famous\" deserts. I ordered a Key lime pie slice and my friend got some chocolate cake. \nSammy brought the slices over to us and I noticed something odd. \nThere were fruit flies. On the top of my key lime pie. \nLet me repeat that. Fruit flies. On top of my pie. Two of them. Just chilling there. \nI called Sammy back over and asked what was up with these little bugs in my cake and he went off about there being a bug problem and how someone was bringing them in to sabotage them or something. He also said it better not me me or my friend or he'd throw us both out. No comp, no new pie slice, nothing. I had to eat the price of my bug pie. Because he thought I put it there. We paid our overly expensive bill and left as quickly as possible. \nThe experience wasn't as bad as what we saw on Tv, but I've still never been treated like that, as a customer, in my life. \nOne star for a clean bathroom, cute decore and a clean place to sit.

{"rating": "4 star rating", "comment": "When playing the lottery, we trade a small sum of money for a little excitement -- for the anticipation of experiencing an uncertain but potentially fabulous outcome.  In the wake of Amy's Baking Company's legendary social media implosion, I saw stopping by ABC for dinner as something like playing the lottery.  One could possibly witness the \"fireworks\" for which ABC has become so famous, be asked to leave after complaining about the food, or simply enjoy a decent plate of food... in any case, there's no way to lose too horribly.  In my estimation, the price of a drink, an appetizer, and an entree is a very reasonable price to pay for some exhilarating uncertainty.\nAs a preface, I should add that I tried stopping in for lunch.  Their posted business hours seem a bit flexible now, as they were closed at 12:30pm and had a sign posted saying that they would re-open at 5pm.\nUpon entering about 20 minutes after they opened for dinner, I was immediately greeted by a very polite hostess.  The hostess gave me the kind of look that two friends exchange after one friend has experienced a deep personal loss, before broaching the subject of the loss in conversation.  As I was being seated, Samy came to my table and instructed the hostess how to properly seat someone who is dining alone (my girlfriend, a culinary professional in Scottsdale, refused to come with me to her credit).  He told me that his staff are all new to their jobs, and he apologized for any inconvenience -- I assured him that the hostess was doing her job very well, and he happily took that compliment.\nMy order was taken promptly by a gregarious server, and I did not have to wait long at all for my appetizer (roasted red pepper hummus and flatbread) to arrive.  The flatbread was cooked evenly and to the correct consistency, and the hummus was flavorful and balanced.  My entree (fettuccine alfredo) arrived maybe fifteen minutes after the appetizer.  The sauce was wonderful and the pasta was cooked perfectly, though the dish was drowning in sauce.  I don't mind this at all as the flatbread helped me to make short work of whatever sauce didn't reach my mouth with the pasta, though I'm sure others would prefer a smaller alfredo/fettuccine ratio.\nWhile enjoying my food, Samy and my server checked on me several times without being too intrusive, with the exception of the guy who asked three times if I wanted my hummus and flatbread boxed.\nI'm sure that I'll receive some nasty messages for writing a generally positive review of ABC, but it would be dishonest of me to misrepresent my experience.  As I walked out the door after finishing my food, I thanked Samy for the enjoyable meal and wished him and his wife the best.  ABC clearly hit bottom recently, and one can only hope that they have learned from their very serious mistakes and are now committed to providing their staff and their customers with a better experience.  From the negative reviews provided by others since last week's re-opening, it appears that they still have lots of work to do -- though from my experience tonight, perhaps they are on the right track.", "date": "May 26, 2013"},

The problem with Scottsdale is that it is such a fast paced city that they have forgotten what a genuine sit down restaurant is. This is a place that you come to when you do not have any time constraints and are willing to wait for some damn good food cooked by single chef with some serious talent. Back east, people flock to restaurants like this one, waiting for hours to taste the deliciousness cooked up by one person.

Excited about the antics my friend and I were sure to encounter, we decided to take the trip to Scottsdale and experience the drama for ourselves. Instead, we found a welcoming environment, brilliant mood lighting and music, exceptional service and a satisfying meal.\nOur server did a wonderful job making my friend and I feel as though we were the center of every ounce of her attention. Frequent check ups and a friendly demeanor made us feel right at home. Sammy himself made a stop at our table and made sure we were satisfied.\nTo be entirely honest, as he approached our table, a part of me anticipated an awkward exchange followed by a heated confrontation. Much to my surprise (and my delight), Sammy seemed genuinely concerned with the satisfaction of my friend and I as well as the other customers in the restaurant.\nAs my friend and I walked out of the restaurant, we couldn't help but gawk at the assortment of desserts the front counter.

We arrived pretty early so there were only 6 tables with a few people.  \nThings must have settled down because the atmosphere was very pleasant.   \nI started with the crisp romaine salad a nice mixture of  red onion & sweet tomatoes with the creamy lemon dill dressing.  Very nice...I was surprised by the lemon dill dressing.\nMy wife ordered the Insalata Capresse,  baby organic spinach leaves tossed with homemade preserved lemons, kalamata olives, sweet tomatoes, fresh basil and fresh mozzarella cheese, drizzled with basil pesto & dusted with sea salts. I can't believe how wonderfully Amy merged these flavors to create an unbelievable salad.  As strange as this seems I would actually come back just for this Salad.\nI ordered the puttanesca gnocchi.  Amy prepares it in a robust tomato sauce with capers, garlic, anchovies black olives and parm cheese.  I think she used pureed kalamata olives as the base in the sauce which gave it a slightly salty taste.  I think I prefer it this way over usually sauted black olives.  Once again, Amy really made this dish shine. I know people will think I am crazy but this sauce can stand up against Scalini Fedeli in NYC any day.  I love Scalini and never thought I would find a puttanesca in AZ that could compare.\nMy wife ordered the asparagus pizza.  Yes I know, sometimes if the chef doesn't know what they are doing the asparagus doesn't come out right.  Not to worry, Amy does it right, all the while making sure the crust stayed nice and crisp.  She combines basil pesto, fresh goat cheese, basil, prosciutto, asparagus & mozzarella to make a nice pie.\nHopefully ABC will be open for brunch on Sunday.

{"rating": "2 star rating", "comment": "I kept waffling between 2 and 3 stars, but then I realized that, no, things were not A-Ok (the 3 star rating) but Meh. I've experienced better (the 2 star rating) fit mostly where the food was concerned.\nFirst and foremost I was hesitant to even write a review.  Could I be impartial and simply review the food and service, leave all the negativity that has been swirling around this place and the owner considering I was in fine dining for years?  Also I am a small business owner and was appalled by their behavior to customers and employees and was a bit embarrassed to even be giving them my business.  On a lark I sent in a reservation request to their Grand Reopening and was very surprised when I got an email saying I was in.  But I thought long and hard and decided yes I can and here it goes.\nThe food was ok, not horrible, not great, but there were execution problems that need to be addressed.  First we got the cilantro hummus and the herbed flat bread. The flavor was good, bread was cooked well, no issues here.  \nSecond we ordered the French Onion soup, my favorite soup in the world.  The portion size was great, the flavor of the broth was spot on but there was hardly any cheese melted on the top.  I like to get a huge chewy mouthful of cheesy goodness and I didn't because I couldn't, not enough cheese!  Also there was barely any onions in it!  Broth and bread basically made up this soup.  Also it was so hot it scalded both myself and my fianc\u00e9.  I know, soup should be hot, but this was way too hot.\nI ordered for my main course the spinach and ricotta ravioli with basil pesto, bacon and mushrooms.  I was shocked when it came out in a shallow bowl and looked like soup.  The whole thing was literally swimming in the sauce.  The sauce itself actually tasted quite good, but since it overpowered everything else in the bowl it made for a lackluster experience.  I couldn't even taste the spinach and ricotta raviolis, such delicate flavors that didn't even have a chance.  The mushrooms would have been lovely if there were a bit more of them and not cut so paper thin.  The bacon and wilted spinach on top would have been another great flavor level but again, you couldn't really get your mouth to taste them.  \nWe also ordered the gnocchi with tomato basil, exact same problem as the raviolis, it was a soup!  The gnocchi were actually perfectly cooked and pillowy.  Both the pasta dishes could have been great but fell flat.\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered one of the burgers, I was pretty full and didn't get a chance to try it but he said it was pretty good but the outside was charred.  I thought the price tag of $14 was a bit much, especially since it didn't come with fries.\nLast we had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, it was perfect, but I don't know how you could mess that up.  The dessert case itself looked very inviting and if I wasn't full I would have opted to try a few more items.\nOn to the wait staff, everyone was brand new and while they were very friendly and efficient, none of them had tasted anything on the menu.  This is appalling to me, how are they suppose to give recommendations if they don't even know what any of the food tastes like?  \nThere was no craziness going on, the mood was actually quite subdued, Samy was going up to tables talking to customers, but didn't stop by ours.  The place wasn't busy at all, but I guess they wanted the Grand Reopening to be not so hectic.  Also the timing on our food wasn't bad, we waited about 30 minutes after our appetizers to get our main courses.  \nI said this would be the one and only time I go there but I think I might go back in a month or two, just to see if things have changed.  Of course I will be keeping up on the going ons over there.  Maybe they have learned from their mistakes, who knows, only time will tell.", "date": "May 23, 2013"},

{"rating": "3 star rating", "comment": ".\nI ACTUALLY ATE THERE LAST NIGHT!!  - Unlike 99% of the \"reviewers\" here!\n(Check the photo album for a pic of my receipt) \n(I ate there Tuesday, May 21-- The Grand Reopening night)\nWe were invited to the grand reopening and got the first reservations at 5:00.  We were the first two parties seated when they opened the doors.\nYes, Samy was there working the front of the house and Amy was doing the cooking.  There was a crowd waiting but you had to be on \"the list\" to get in. It seemed like they sat 2 tables every few minutes so they didn't get slammed with 100 orders all at once.\nThere were reporters and gawkers all over outside but also Scottsdale police, security and the PR people guarding the door. They also had a professional video crew and photographers inside. We had to sign waivers to get in..\nWe were the first seated.  It was obvious that the staff was probably all brand new and understandably quite awkward with their first very customers. \nWe ordered the infamous \"truffle oil\" bacon burger and a pizza.  After ordering, just like on the show, the servers were grouped behind Samy, looking over his shoulder, waiting for him to enter their orders into the terminal.  \nThe food came out in a fairly reasonable amount of time and was actually quite good.  \nThe pizza was perfectly cooked and the nice thick burger was tasty and moist but not at all \"soggy\".  The burger was $14.50 and didn't include fries, but did have a small garnish salad on the side of the plate. It looked hand formed and was more than an inch thick.  The pizza was quite good and a pretty darn reasonable value. \nSamy came over a few times to ask how things were and when he saw us all typing into our phones and taking pictures of our food,  he just asked us only to think for ourselves, be fair, and tell the truth.   \nWe were there for just about 2 hours but that was mostly because they were slow getting started after being closed for days, had a brand new crew and were also managing the circus there. \n \nWe asked about Amy.  Samy said she personally cooks every single meal and could not step out of the kitchen.  We did spot her a few times and sure enough was speeding around working her butt off in the kitchen.   \nAs we were leaving, I began to think the drama on the show was actually real. \n \nSamy was nice enough,  but clearly the stress was building and that's not good for someone who doesn't seem to handle stress well.  \nAs the place began getting more full and the flow was going, there were 15 or so tables in play.  They were in various stages of being seated, ordering, eating, paying and waiting to be bussed, the wheels began to come off.  \nHe politely asked us how everything was but as I briefly responded he began to loudly clap his hands together, as you would at a bad dog,  and yell at a bus boy about not doing his job and his need to listen for the bell.  \nSo bottom line, the food was much better than it looked on TV but I saw enough to believe the volatile personalities, and subsequent trainwreck, were very real.\nI've received a few questions about the waiver:\nThere were a bunch of TV stations and newspaper reporters there but they were being chased away from the door by the security guards and actual Scottsdale police.\nInside was a photographer and a video crew taping everything.  \nThe waiver was a pretty standard \"You know we're taping this, we're not paying you and we can do whatever we want with the tape\" type deal.  \nI'm not sure what the taping was for, but they weren't intrusive.\n.", "date": "May 22, 2013"},

Samy the owner couldn't have been nicer. After dinner the chef, Amy, came out to inquire how we liked the dinners. I had the Fig Pear Prosciutto pizza which I thought was a touch too sweet, but my wife and friends loved it. That shows that taste is subjective, a good point to remember when reviewing. Almost ordered the Pasta Rustica which I will try when we return and we will return. My buddy had the eggplant Parmesan and said it was one of the best ever. Not soft and gooey as often prepared. The baked Penne was also very good. For an app we split the Lemon Cilantro Hummus with great herb flatbread. We were going to order 2 of them but Samy said one would be sufficient. $3 and it fed all four of us!. Our total bill with a glass of wine each was less than $60 a couple! I don't want to minimize the complaints others have but I really don't get it. I will agree the waitress could have been more friendly and acted more as a bus boy as Samy took our orders. Some people expect others to be gracious when they are acting like a**holes. Not saying this is the case here but my patience is very thin and if someone is rude or critical of me.....be prepared.

{"rating": "2 star rating", "comment": "I went to ABC during the filming of Kitchen Nightmares, so that should tell you something right there. I already knew all about the hoopla surrounding this place and decided it was an experience not to be missed. Plus, I love Gordon Ramsay. \nThe first night of reservations was a cluster-f. I never made it inside and was given a reservation for the following evening instead. In their defense, they had a problem with the POS that seemed to be like a ... nightmare. Ironic, no? We decided to have dinner on the patio next door and watched a very dramatic night unfold at ABC.\nThe second night, we made it in. First off, let me just say that since this dining experience was rather atypical, I felt like some of the other diners were purposely trying to find things wrong with their meal. Aside from the fact that it's awkward to stuff your face with pasta in front of a camera, I tried my best to be impartial.\nShortly after we were seated, Gordon eighty-sixed the ravioli for being of the frozen, store bought variety. No surprise there considering the reviews. I had already known to steer clear. I played it safe and ordered the bolognese. It was fine, but nothing to come back for. On the other hand, the pizza and humus were actually pretty darn good. None of us found any reason to complain about the food. In fact, I actually really enjoyed my boyfriend's sweet and spicy pasta rustica. I believe Amy makes the sweet and spicy marmalade cream sauce from scratch. It was quite good, if you like a bit of kick. \nMy table was pretty agreeable until the bill arrived. I think this is where ABC struggles: customer service. If the customer has a problem, for some reason it is not smoothed over. The staff and owners go immediately on the defensive. You literally have to fight to make it right. It seemed very unreasonable to me that we had to point out to them what their menu stated. It didn't matter that we ordered it or double checked when it arrived to make sure that our order was correct. When the bill arrived and it was still incorrect, we were told that we were wrong. We had to point out that they were wrong by using their menu as evidence. Ridiculous.   \nAs we were waiting for the corrected bill, Gordon brought to light some sketchy practices concerning the tip money. It seems the owners are skimming from the waitresses tips. I'm not exactly sure what was going on, but there was an argument where Gordon threw out the term \"slave labor.\" Amy then came out to add that the cameras weren't around to see the waitresses when they were just standing around, as if that were a good enough excuse for the tip controversy. A few of the other patrons were pretty surprised and dismayed to find out how little the waitresses were paid. Hopefully, that is something that will be resolved because of the show. I would hate to think I tipped the owner 20% to argue with him over the size of pizza my dining companion ordered. Either way, the customer service and the behavior of the owners was a HUGE turnoff. \nIn conclusion, ABC's biggest problem is customer service. There is none. The waitresses are scared, under-appreciated young girls, just trying to make it through the night. The food, for the most part, is actually pretty good. At least when Gordon is around kicking ass. I can't wait to see how this place is turned around because of the show. Personally, I hope the owners realize you catch a lot more bees with honey.", "date": "Dec 13, 2012"},

After a couple of weeks, my wife and I decided to give it a try.  That was a mistake.\nFirst, with the positive(s), the prices were actually reasonable.  Given the location, I had expected our dinners to be more expensive than they actually were.  Unfortunately, that was the only positive of the night.  The reasonable prices could not even compensate for the lack of service or flavor.  It took our server at least 15 minutes to bring our water even though the restaurant was sparsely populated.  We were ready to order by then but, apparently, she wasn't ready to take it.  Eventually, we ordered a Caesar salad, a Greek salad, and a Garlic Chicken Mushroom 12\" pizza.  The pizza had virtually no chicken on it...  And the chicken that was present had been severely overcooked.  The mushrooms were soggy and the garlic was absolutely overwhelming.  Moreover, our server informed us of a surcharge for any additional Parmesan cheese.  She looked annoyed after I politely declined to pay/order the extra cheese.\nWe didn't even stay to try the dessert as I had lost whatever remaining appetite I had by that point.\nDo yourself a favor and DO NOT try this restaurant.

However, it was disappointing seeing the owner turn away a family of four with two young children citing that reservations were required when the restaurant was only a third occupied. Two minutes later a couple came into the restaurant and were immediately seated at a table for 4 without reservations.  As parents, it was seeing this discrimination that resulted in our overall grade of 1 star.\nI am attaching the response I received from the Owner below.  I think it illustrates his attitude toward customer service:\n**** Owner Response *****\nHello Stephen,\nYes I did refuse a family this evening without reservations; I actually refused hundreds of people earlier, as I do every weekend.\nLast time I checked I have every legal right to refuse service to anyone. I did not refuse this family due to the fact that they had children with them I refused them because they did not have a reservation. \nIf you think that my Restaurant deserves one star because of that, and if you feel better about yourself by posting some stupid, pointless review on YELP, then perhaps next time you should eat at The Pita Jungle. \nWe send tons of people like you to them on a daily basis. So enjoy!!\nAdditionally perhaps you should be Man enough to post your picture next to your review. So we can see who you are. It is very easy to hide behind a computer screen while virally attacking hard working business owners. We have a name for people like you. \"The Camel Toe Mafia\".

So we came for dinner, and the rest, as they say, is history. We ordered a pizza italiano, a classic combination of sausage pepperoni, and fresh cilantro on the best thin crust you can imagine. Only better. Full disclosure: I am not normally a fan of thin crust, but this made me a believer. And then, wait for it, we also ordered a second 10 \" pizza that raised the bar where few, if any, will reach. Picture Marco Polo coming back from China  - that is the Duck Pizza, a magical mix of duck proscuitto, gouda, mozzerela,\nhoisin sauce, cilantro, and peanuts. I had them hold the peanuts, and it was perfect.\nThe peanuts move the pizza from China to Thailand.\nWe had a pot of pomegranite tea with a huge square of creme brulee - no fruit thank you, the classic, and it did not disappoint. A side of caramel sauce was provided graciously, and defied physics by actually making it even better.\nThis is a place you go to, and then come back until you have tried everything - because you know it will all be great. \nThe ambience is charming, the service elegant, and while not inexpensive, it is a fantastic value and a great bargain given the completely homemade, as in from scratch, flavor that you can taste in every dish.\nWord of warning: this place is so good it may well ruin you for other restaurants. \nMy only beef? Sometimes they close earlier than their posted hours, so you may want to call ahead to be sure and let them know you're coming. It took us three tries before they were open during their posted hours.

{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "My first time visiting Scottsdale, I decided to try ABC Bistro for myself. Even though I was terrified of some of the reviews, I wanted to see if they were correct. \nTo my dismay, they were. First, I was made to sit on the patio. NO ONE was inside the restaurant (which means I should've left). I have small children, it was about 2 in the afternoon meaning it was hot as hell outside, and there was no reason I should've needed to sit on the patio. But whatever, couldn't help it due to the rude waitstaff. I was outside waiting to be acknowledged for 20 minutes with zero other customers. I think that when a customer is in the restaurant, you should serve them. It was the shittiest service I have ever received anywhere, bathroom attendants at my hotel were better than these people. \nThe food was awful. Flat ravioli with barely any stuffing, reheated, gross pizza and flat drinks. I almost didn't pay for the joke of the food I had gotten. If I visit Scottsdale again, ABC Bistro is not somewhere I would go. I can't possibly recommend this place to anyone because its not worth going, waiting and eating tasteless, overpriced cafeteria food. I tapped on the glass to get the waitress and she looked at me and came a few minutes later. Look, what the hell are you doing when there are no other customers that you can't help the one person dumb enough to try this dump? She didn't get a tip and I would never set foot in this horrendous eatery again. Yelp made me give it at least one star, but I was trying to give it none. What a disappointment. \nI personally think it should be closed down and these people should find another line of work, because the restaurant business isn't for them.", "date": "Sep 3, 2011"},

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "I rarely, if ever, write reviews; however, this is pretty shocking. I actually found this review trying to find a number for Amy's so that I can order dinner, and was shocked by what I read.  I live within walking distance of Amy's but only tried it for the first time with a friend a couple of months ago.  When walking past it occasionally while walking my pooch it always appeared to be fairly empty, which is typically a bad sign for a restaurant.  Despite the seemingly frightening availability of seats my friend and I decided to give Amy's a chance and we were pleasantly surprised - the food and service were great. In fact, the pizza was the some of the best I've had since moving here and that is saying a lot as I am from Chicago and relocated to the area from Brooklyn, where I lived for 2 years.  By no means am I an expert, but I've had my fair share of delicious pizza!  I thought that the gentleman who served us was very polite and accommodating as he rushed our order knowing that we were attempting to grab dinner before a movie. \nI came in again for the pizza a month later and he remembered me and apologized in advance for the delay because he was short-staffed and attending to a fairly large party. I was still able to get my pizza to go without any issues and I was even offered a free appetizer due to the wait; although, I did not wait for that long. So my service experience has clearly been different.  I've also never tried going there for dinner at 10 PM as I didn't even know there were restaurants (non-chain at least) in Scottsdale opened that late any night of the week lol.\nI've had a few items off the menu - the caramelized onion and fig pizza (my favorite item), the crostinis (they are offered with a couple of different toppings), the appetizer of french fries, the monte cristo, and the martini with pomegranate juice. I can't think of a single complaint on any of the dishes that I've tried.\nI will say that well its Scottsdale and I am fairly shocked when I see people whine about prices. You can go across the street to Dickie's and spend $15 on the world's worse bbq, so I think $14 for a reasonably sized pizza really isn't that bad. Even at Pita Jungle you'll be hard-pressed to spend less than $10 on a pita and side item whereas in most mom-and-pop Greek \"dives\" in Chicago I can get a d!%# good gyros with hand cut fries for about $6. \nI'll also acknowledge that the owner's response to criticism was unprofessional. I can understand that criticism, even when constructive, can be hard to take but it has become a part of the business.  Customers no longer just go home unsatisfied; they go home and blog about their unsatisfactory experience.\nIn short, I will still head to Amy's and enjoy my pizza dinner, while most likely walking on egg shells to avoid making anyone angry lol. I'd recommend giving the place a shot (at the very least try the pizza with caramelized onions, prosciutto and figs!) and forming an opinion of your own despite the reviews.

This is actually my first time.  \nAnyway, I have eaten at this place with different people on four occasions now, and each time, the food has been fantastic.  The pizza crust is so delicious you will dream about it at night.  The pastas and appetizers I have tried have also been great across the board.  \nI found the owner to be very friendly, and he even offered to put our leftovers in the fridge for us on a couple of occasions while we went to see a movie across the way.  \nSo, I hope people will give this place a chance despite some of the negative reviews out there.

{"rating": "2 star rating", "comment": "Visited this place on Friday night at 10:05 p.m. We were pleased to see ABC Bistro stayed open until11:00 p.m. and decided to go for it. We enter and Samy says to sit in the patio. We asked to stay inside and he said no, on the patio, because we have to clean up for tomorrow.  That should have been a sign, but we stayed. He offered to turn the misters on but never did.\nTHE GOOD:\nFor $12, the Salmon burger and honey citrus salad were really excellent. The bun was surprisingly good, and the dressing on the salad was among the very best I've ever tried. The burger was more of a fried salmon croquette, which was unexpected because I don't like fried food too much and did not think I was ordering a fried dish, but it also was good.\nThe restroom was impeccable, and the restaurant inside was tastefully decorated and scrupulously clean. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to sit inside...\nTHE BAD: \nSoft drinks are $3.50 and refills were not forthcoming. Yes, I know it's about a dollar more per drink than is customary in similar establishments, but for some reason it bugged me, maybe because it was hot on the patio.\nFor $12, you get 10 gnocchi swimming in a half a quart of marinara with a generous amount of oil slicking the top of it. If you wish to add more parmesan than the minuscule amount that comes with it, be prepared to pay extra. When is the last time you paid extra for parmesan cheese in a restaurant? The vast amount of sauce and small portion of gnocchi was really puzzling. The marinara itself was a bit acidic and somewhat bitter. Other reviewers also mentioned that the sauce is generous and the portions less so, and that was our experience as well. After having finished all the gnocchi, about 10 ounces of sauce were left on the soup plate. Interestingly, no bread was offered, which is surprising for a bread company.\nAround 10:15 the ugly bright lights come on inside and light up the patio, killing the mood. The waitresses start pulling up all the tablecloths outside, leaving us surrounded by naked plastic tables.\nThe waitresses and Samy were busy cleaning and we were the only table left in the restaurant. After waiting for some time alone on the patio, we knocked on the glass to get their attention.\nWe asked for our check, paid and left. We would have offered constructive criticism, but thought we'd cut our losses and leave. I would not return, mainly because of the attitude, the fact that parmesan and bread costs extra, and the wrecking of the mood with the cleanup and bright lights. I can overlook a dish I didn't enjoy, but not this attitude where the last two customers are an inconvenience.", "date": "May 29, 2011"},

I would have recommended this place to anyone and have lived in Scottsdale full-time for 45 years.  Fast forward to recent times, a night with regulars and winter visitors and special events attendees, so business was good  for ABC and customer service was in the tank.  After waiting 10 minutes after being seated, was curtly told that ALL of the items on the happy hour hours menu were not available and before drinks could be ordered or other items considered, the menus were abruptly taken away.  Walked out of the place and will never return, will not recommend it to anyone and will retract any recommendations given to the restaurant.  Never have been treated by a restaurant owner in such a rude manner - based on their snarky attacks on negative reviews here, they truly depict why some people call my hometown \"Snottsdale.\"  Couple of points here - first an off night in a kitchen or service can be excused with a sincere apology - these things happen.  But knowing the potential for rudeness by owners is inexcusable whether they think the customer deserves it or not.  Please don't offer a menu if you don't want people to order from it.

After hearing about the brouhaha between the owner and a reviewer, I had to write one myself. When I went, I had awful service too. I sat indoors (I really think Joel must have been crazy to sit on the patio in the summer in Phx), but the waitress took over 5 minutes to greet me, 5 more minutes to bring me my drink and come take my order, she couldn't knowledgeably answer questions about the menu, and she failed to ask if I wanted anything else...I had to order my dessert to go because she took so long to come back to the table. The environment is not a very friendly one and I am not surprised that Joel had that experience ( I was dining alone as well). Your experience can be colored by your frame of mind and single guests often want to talk and be \"entertained,\" so to speak by the waiters--especially when it's their first time. I won't lie, the pizza I had was DELISH, something with capers and anchovies (I know, not for everyone) and I was very impressed with my dessert, which I ate at home, but I don't like the service and that's 70% of the experience. Bottom line is that they're not irreplaceable because their product, while good, isn't overly unique and the service is the tipping point into \"why bother.\" If someone else really wanted to go there, I'd go, but as for me, probably never again because of this:\nDear Joel,L. It is blatantly obvious to me why you were ALONE on a Saturday night! \nRead any of the reviews that have been written about us and you will see that EVERYONE loves us!! The only people that don't  is our \"Competition\". We knew you had been sent by another restaurant before you even ordered your $14.00 Pizza. \nThe Pizza was fresh and amazing. The reason the tomatoes had different texture was because I use three different heirloom tomatoes and some of them are sundried. So of course they are going to have a different texture from the fresh ones!!!\nBut perhaps you are only accustomed to tasting the ones that come \"fresh from the can!\"\nMoving on to the \"Store bought Dough\" Comment. PLEASE!! My dough is made fresh every day from 100% organic ingredients. Perhaps your palate is not sophisticated enough to tell the difference.\nAs for you having the Patio all to yourself unless you have been living on another PLANET it is summertime in ARIZONA MORON!!! Only TRAMPS and LOSERS want to sit outside in 110 temperatures!!!!\nWe are hiring because we are so busy that we need to hire more people. You just so happened to come right after a huge rush. And the people did not change their mind for the Margarita Pizza they ordered. They were still enjoying their amazing Caesar salad and I thought perhaps you would appreciate not having to wait so long for your pizza.  Which was just coming out of the OVEN.\nI am the CHEF and the owner, and I am the one that made your Pizza.\nAs for the no smoking comment everyone knows that it is against the LAW to smoke within 20 feet of a public place. But perhaps you think you are above the LAW. Have a little respect not everyone wants to subject themselves to being around second hand smoke.\nAnd as for the overpriced menu items if you think that $12.00 is too much for an ENTR\u00c9E sized ORGANIC Salad or $14.00 is too much for an AMAZING Pizza then perhaps you should go to the PITA JUNGLE that is just a stone's throw away. And if you get lucky maybe you can even dig up someone up to take with you so you can share a $5.00 Falafel.\nDo US a favor and keep your ugly face and you ugly opinions to yourself and go back to the restaurant that you really work at!!\nI would LOVE for anyone who reads this review to come to ABC and try our Pizza. If you don't like it then I guarantee you don't have to pay for it.\"\n*Amy needs to understand that your food can be utterly fabulous, but you MUST control your urge to vent on public forums.

{"rating": "2 star rating", "comment": "I have debated about writing since i heard about the Joel/Amy battle, but decided to put in my two cents.  \nI first went to Amy's quite a few years ago when they first opened.  I had heard from several family members who had happened by and bought dessert.  Knowing how big of a dessert fiend I was the alerts kept coming.  From my first experience I was sold.  It was not just the desserts though the other food was very good and I brought several people in to dine there.\nIn general most people thought it was overpriced, but my husband and I don't normally let that stop up unless it is obscene.  My employees even bought me a red velvet cake from there and got me a gift certificate.\nWell for whatever reason we didn't go there for a little while and when we did go there was a sign saying that it was closed as Amy had health problems.  We were very sad.  I had met Amy several times and I will tell you she is passionate about her food and when encountering foodies she is very excited to talk about it.  \nI watched the website and then one day they were back.  The day we went we had just spent the night on the far west side of the valley after going to party that lasted very late and had a bit of alcohol.  We live on the east side and I was really excited that we could go to Amy's on the way around the 101.  \nWhen we got there it was relatively early on a Sunday and we were alone but for one other table.  We quickly went to work with the menu and ordered several things knowing we would have wonderful food to take home.  \nWhere things went amiss is when we went to play a game while waiting for our food.  Amy's husband came over and to be honest I can't remember exactly what he said (I am forever mortified by the whole experience) but we were essentially told they were not \"that kind of place\" and we were not welcome.  We had just gotten beverages and I told my husband just to pay for it and let's go.  I am not a public scene kind of person and I was very upset.  The server didn't want to come near us as I recall she wouldn't make eye contact and even hid behind the counter.   Finally the husband rang it up and out we went. \nAt that point I didn't want to eat anywhere I just wanted to go home.  I have never even discussed this with anyone but my family that saw me after when we picked up our dogs.  (Dogs that once upon a time sat on Amy's patio while we enjoyed our food.)   My husband called them afterwards. To my further mortification he spoke directly with Amy and she defended her husband and their decisions about what goes on at their restaurant.  \nNow I don't disagree with them saying no games at their restaurant.  It is their place and that means their rules, but it was just the way it was handled.  You can't go around making people feel less than and in Amy's response to Joel it was very clear again that there are some strong prejudices occurring.  \nObviously I won't ever go back and the gift certificate long sits in a drawer unused.  There are places in town that are better and many more that are worse, but overall it is customer service that ultimately will make the difference.", "date": "Aug 4, 2010"},

How Rude! The pizza was over cooked with soggy tomatoes on it. I have eaten pizza all over the east coast and in Italy. This pizza does not even come close. They seemed offended when I let them know I was displeased. I left most of my pizza there. I also got the worst heart burn as if it were loaded with tomato paste.

{"rating": "4 star rating", "comment": "Let's all take a deep breath and let it out slowly. Despite Joel's personally unpleasant experience at Amy's Baking Company, and Amy's, not so diplomatic to some, response, I encourage all of you to give Amy's Baking Company & Bistro a try.  \nI had been going to Amy's for quite some time, until I recently moved out of state.  I have to fight reoccurring cravings for some of Amy's deliciously prepared dishes and desserts!  I would agree with Sean M, that Amy has this way of creating refreshingly different dishes, which are normally uninspiring and boringly prepared elsewhere.  As for her pizza, I don't rank it as my top favorite (Pizzeria Bianco's can't be beat, sorry Amy), but her pizza is amazingly unique in it's toppings, and that is why I love to have it from time to time.\nAmy and her husband are so proud, as they should be, of their restaurant.  Anyone that comes to know Amy, knows that she is incredibly passionate about what she does~ creating fabulous, delicious, and visually pleasing foods for all to enjoy.  So, let's cut Amy some slack, give her a pass on this onetime oops, and go enjoy one of her masterpieces!  \nPS: If I could have given a 4.5, I would!  I am not a foodie, or a chef, nor do I own a restaurant.  I've come to know and love Amy and her husband....through my many visits to their bistro.  It isn't an absolutely perfect 5, sometimes the service seems slow....compared to the fast paced American lifestyle.  Her philosophy is that one should slow down and savor the flavors of her creations, European style, but I don't always have the patients. (She is right you know....we should all slow down a bit!....and be a bit more forgiving.)\nPSS: Please don't be a blind follower of one person's opinion. One can only truly form their own reasonable opinion, in this case give a proper review, AFTER they have experienced something for themselves. Forming an opinion based on reviews from people that have never even been to, or experienced, a business is irresponsible.  Weed out those 'blind follower' reviews, and then make a decision to go or not.  Creating a review without direct or credible indirect experience is simply worthless gossip.", "date": "Aug 4, 2010"},
{"rating": "4 star rating", "comment": "I like Amy's Baking Company.  I like the food and the owners.  I have always been treated with respect.  As I've learned the menu, there are items that are favorites and others that I won't repeat.  To each his own taste.  That doesn't mean you should expect to be comped when you and the dish don't agree; it was still prepared and served.  Overall the fare is a great value.\nAs to the pizza being too hot then quickly too cold....curious, tomatoes always carry heat for a long time.  And, I don't know how that could even suggest store bought.  Amy makes the dough from scratch. \nSmoking is wrong on so many levels, especially at a restaurant and even when you are the only one outside.  It ruins the taste of a meal for those around and is against the law.  \nAs to the owners sticking up for their business, that seems not only fair but reflects the concern the owners have for their reputation.  And, as we all know, it takes time and effort and resources to establish a good rep which can all too easily be damaged by one negative comment.  By responding, you know they don't agree with the comment.\nAs to the customer always being right, those days are long gone.  They ended when people stopped having common courtesy.  They ended when business margins barely make family owned restaurants possible.\nThey ended when we stopped checking things for ourselves and let others make the decision for us.  Small businesses including Amy's will try to accommodate their customer's real dissatisfaction but there are limits to what they can do.  \nTry Amy's for yourself.  If you listened to the friend who said the Grand Canyon was a hole in the ground, you would have let others decide that a Wonder Of The World wasn't worth seeing.", "date": "Aug 4, 2010"},

Amy and Samy always welcome us into their bistro as though we are family! Amy does all the baking herself using her own recipes. I'm addicted to the fig, pear, and prosciutto pizza! I have never tasted pizza crust like this anywhere else! Amy grows her own herbs, heirloom tomatoes and figs. Everything is fresh from her garden--grown, harvested, and baked with the utmost care. The pasta dishes are remarkable!\nABC Bistro is also a feast for the eyes.

{"rating": "1 star rating", "comment": "In retrospect, I should have known better than to step foot into Amy's Baking Company (a.k.a. ABC Bistro).  \n-8 pm on a Saturday night, three tables are occupied\n-a sign on the door indicates they're looking for an experienced line cook, a dishwasher, waitresses, you name it\n-Pita Jungle, just a stone's throw away, is packed to the gills\nThese are all bad signs.  They go ignored, however, because I'd eaten one thing all day, and I had drove here to try their pizza.  Never, ever again.\nThe waitress brings me out a water and a menu to my table for one  on the patio, which I had all to myself.  Browsing the apps, I was pleasantly surprised to see several things priced $3, which seemed like a bargain, given the high price of everything else.  $3 tapanade sounded like a good deal, but I was informed that it didn't come with anything - it was $3 extra for bread.  Since I was solo, I decided to skip it and instead pay $14 for their 12\" margherita pizza.  \nAbout three minutes later, the waitress drops off my pizza.  \"Your pizza\", she says, leaves a plate and off she goes.  I sat for a moment, confused as to how things happened so quickly.  I try to grab a slice of the pizza, but it was so blazing hot that I wasn't even going to attempt to handle it.  I waited for a few minutes to let it cool off, only to discover that not only had it cooled enough to handle, but was actually well-cooled and most likely reheated.  After a closer inspection of the pie in front of me, it was evident that it had been reheated, as there were smaller tomatoes that had spent their time in the oven, and larger tomatoes that had barely been kissed by the heat of the oven.\nI took a bite, and was immediately underwhelmed.  The crust had very little character, was slightly sweet but had that store-bought quality to it.  The pesto tasted okay, but the tomatoes were completely tasteless and overall, it just fell flat.  It's margherita - the ingredients need to shine to make such a simple pizza.  These ingredients were sub-par.  After two small pieces, I decided I was wasting my calories and just gave up on it.\nSo I sat outside, not eating, and sat.  And sat.  Where the hell was the waitress?  I glanced inside a few times, hoping to catch her eye, but she must have been occupied elsewhere.  \nThe owner comes out.  \"How'd you like your pizza?\"  Instead of immediately responding, I asked how it had come out so quickly.  In short, he told me another table had ordered it, decided they didn't want it, and it sat in the kitchen for two minutes, who in turn decided to send it out to me since I didn't order anything else.  \nMe: \"Well, it didn't really taste fresh\".\nHim: \"No, no, our pizzas are the best.  Ask our customers.  You're the first person since we've opened to ever not like our pizzas\".  \nHe got very defensive about the pizza, but I hadn't really launched a harsh criticism on the pizza, just said I didn't really enjoy it.  So I sat some more, with an empty drink, and realized they wanted me gone.  The owner wouldn't make eye contact with me.  The server never came back out asking if I wanted something else.  And they still hadn't refilled my drink.\nSo I sat on a patio, alone, and decided to have a smoke.  The waitress comes out...\nHer: \"Sir, there's a no smoking sign over there, I was told to tell you to not to smoke here.\"  \nMe: \"Is this the last f*** you in this experience?\"\nHer: \"Yes, I think so\".\nShe walks away.  I walk inside, pay the bill, and leave.  No apologies, no discounts on the bill, nothing.  $18 for weak iced tea and shitty pizza.\nThis is arrogance in its worst form.  I can forgive bad food, but I cannot forgive misplaced arrogance and the blatant dismissal of a customer, whether you agree with them or not.  \nPerhaps the sign on the door should also say, \"Wanted: New owner\".  \nI cannot, for the life of me, recommend this restaurant to anyone.\n---\nUPDATE:\nSince Yelp's 5000 character limit will not let me post the full response by the owner (Amy B.), here is a link to the comments:\nhttp://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bella/2010/08/ouch_todays_hard_lesson_on_yel.php", "date": "Aug 1, 2010"},

{"rating": "5 star rating", "comment": "For more than a year Amy's Baking Company has stood empty. Periodically the faithful would drive through the parking lot at the N.E. corner of Scottsdale and Shea, craning their necks to check for signs of life. It was a pilgrimage. And finally we've been rewarded. We thank our friend Anna for calling us with the good news.\nIn the time before Amy's closed it garnered glowing reviews from the likes of Phoenix Magazine and the Arizona Republic. Everyone mentioned the upscale decor and the friendliness of chef Amy Bouzaglo  and her husband/host Samy. But mostly they raved about the food - especially the desserts. I'm more than happy to say that nothing's changed, or maybe it's even better. They've added a pizza oven and a long list of designer pizzas. The dessert case was full of cakes and tarts, some of which seem to be new recipes.\nWe ordered fried calamari with a pesto aioli ($10 ), and the hummus platter with wild mushrooms ($10 ). I asked Samy to take a piece of chocolate-orange-raspberry-truffle cake out of the refrigerator case so it would warm to room temperature while we ate our dinner. The calamari were tiny rounds, very tender, lightly breaded with seasoned crumbs. The aioli was delicious, I could have eaten it by itself. But the real hit was the hummus. It's texture was perfect, and it was most thoughtfully seasoned. A very large helping of sauteed mushrooms sat atop. But what capped it off was that it was served with a pizza pan full of Italian flatbread (which is also used for the pizza crust) fresh and hot from the oven, blistered and crunchy. It would make any topping shine.\nWhile we ordered from the antipasti section of the menu, there's lots more to try. Salads, like Caramelized Pear ($12) and Vanilla Bean Coconut Shrimp ($16).Sandwiches: the MonteCristo ($17) is a house specialty, dipped in a French beignet batter and served with homemade raspberry preserves. Butternut squash ravioli is one of my favorites from the pasta selections. And then there's the pizza: fig, pear and prosciutto ($16 for a 12 inch) is my next must-have. While the prices may strike you as on the high side, the portions are big enough to share and the ingredients are top quality.\nThen, the cake. It's time out of the refrigerator case had softened the buttercream and accentuated the flavors. Amy is master of the buttercream - it's never overly sweet. The play of orange and raspberry was intriguing. We also shared a \"creamy iced coffee\" ($4) which went perfectly with the cake. Choosing a dessert isn't easy. Everything looks beautiful - lemon curd tarts, cupcakes, bread pudding, cheese cake, creme brulee. Now that Amy's back we can try all of them.\nA note: Amy and Samy will be serving Thanksgiving dinner. There will be three seatings, and reservations are being taken now. You'll find us there.", "date": "Oct 4, 2009"},

Formerly known solely for their baked goods, this space now has a full-length menu of primarily Italian fare mixed in with what I assume was previously on Amy's menu. \nWe stopped in here on a whim (the packed PJ next door was where we were headed) after a movie. We saw balloons everywhere and \"Grand Opening\" written on the chalkboard out front so we decided to stop in. The service was excellent from the start. We told the host we would like to sit outside and she said, \"Great. I'll follow you to your table.\" Very nice. \nThe interior is interesting. Black chandeliers, black and white checkered tile, and string lights all over the place. A well-lit pastry case features enticing baked goods. The patio is cutesy and romantic with even more string lights and all manner of vines entwining the trellis. There's a real European flavor to the place, despite being inches away from the parking lot and the occasional whiff of popcorn from the theater across the way.  \nI had the pesto gnocchi. It was very good, but unfortunately the prices are a bit presumptuous. Almost every dish was over twelve dollars.

When we told him not to worry, because we would never come back there anyway, he literally said \"PLEASE don't\". And all of this after we had already paid for the broken teapot without questioning whether the price he had demanded was fair. He even went as far as complaning that we had only spent $17 between the two of us. REVOLTING!
